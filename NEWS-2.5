CHANGES FROM 2.5.0-beta1 TO 2.5.0-beta2
---------------------------------------

   (from <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-2.5.0-beta2>)

   Highlights of this release are a new map generator, a basically
   complete Qt client, and a large number of bug fixes.

Server / General

Changes affecting players (supplied rulesets)

     * New map generation features ported from warserver:
          + 'Fair' island map generator ('generator=fair'), which creates
            an identical island for each player or team. GNAPATCH#5146
            GNA#22562 GNA#22564 GNA#22572 GNAPATCH#5179 GNA#22605
            GNA#22904 GNA#22906 GNAPATCH#5409
          + New server setting 'teamplacement', allowing control of
            whether team-mates start near each other on the map.
            GNAPATCH#5145
     * Barbarian players no longer get a free Palace when they conquer a
       city. (This was a recent regression, only introduced in beta1.)
       GNA#22340
     * When a city is struck by plague, it now cannot grow again in the
       same turn. GNA#22803
     * When following orders into fogged territory, a unit will now abort
       its orders if it runs into an unexpected unit or city on its last
       step (rather than blindly attacking, etc). GNA#20618
     * When there are multiple possible transports for a unit to load
       onto, the server is cleverer about choosing one. Among other
       criteria, idle transports are preferred, as are those from which
       units can unload at any time. This preference order is now used in
       more circumstances. GNAPATCH#4982 GNAPATCH#5367
     * Numerous fixes to research in games with teams:
          + With team_pooled_research enabled:
               o Technology cost now takes into account effects from all
                 players in the team; previously it was picking a random
                 player for Novice AI science penalty, cost reduction from
                 embassies in civ2civ3, etc. GNAPATCH#5098
               o Similarly, tech upkeep now takes into account all players
                 in a team. GNAPATCH#5099 Notably, in the civ2civ3
                 ruleset, upkeep scales with the total number of cities in
                 a team, not those of a random team member. GNA#22158
               o If a technology is lost, all team members share the
                 effects (such as losing their government), and all
                 clients can see that the tech is lost. GNA#21935
               o All clients are kept up to date with accurate progress of
                 current research. GNAPATCH#5100 GNAPATCH#5185 GNA#22705
          + With team_pooled_research disabled: only one player per team
            was getting the free techs given at the start of the game
            (e.g., with the 'techlevel' setting). GNA#22522
     * Other fixes to tech loss:
          + There was a small chance of technology not being lost when it
            should have been. GNA#22576
          + The server's count of a player's technologies was not reduced.
            This could cause technology cost to be too high and have other
            bad effects. GNA#22579
          + Ruleset effects that survived the global loss of a technology
            (such as wonder obsoletion) did not survive a save/reload
            cycle. GNA#22909
     * Fixes to rulesets with root requirements in their technology tree,
       such as the experimental ruleset:
          + Research could fail to pick the next technology toward a
            faraway goal. GNA#22789
          + Fix general slowness (sometimes extreme) in such rulesets.
            GNA#22159 GNAPATCH#5357 GNA#22876
     * Tech upkeep cost was slightly larger than intended. GNA#22912
     * Fix numerous problems with visibility of unit movement and
       destruction:
          + Fix bugs that could leave a 'ghost' unit visible in clients,
            such as land units alone in the sea (GNA#22600):
               o If a foreign unit was briefly visible loading onto a
                 transport.
               o If a barbarian unit reached the end of its life while on
                 a transport.
          + Fix trouble when a city is transferred, particularly by
            diplomatic treaty. GNA#20705
          + Transported units or those in cities could fail to be revealed
            when entering an alliance. GNA#20726 GNA#22851
          + Fix some bugs and error messages related to visibility of
            foreign units loading and unloading from transports.
            GNAPATCH#4912
          + An assertion could fail when foreign transports moved out of
            sight. GNA#22852
          + Fix client error "Server wants us to remove unit" when
            witnessing the defeat of a cargo-carrying transport in a game
            with 'killstack' disabled, or in complicated alliance breakup
            situations. GNA#22721 GNA#22795
          + Fix some bugs related to visibility of units moved or killed
            as a result of other units' movement, for instance by a
            ruleset script; and show unit movement in more cases where
            units move into or out of visibility. GNA#22765 GNA#22853
          + Fix some cases where unit information was not sent correctly
            to global observers. GNA#22764 GNAPATCH#4973
     * Units were spuriously prevented from moving from one transport to
       another. GNA#22380
     * 'unitwaittime' now applies to exploding nuclear units in place as
       well as to regular attacks. GNA#22838
     * Investigating an empty city that was previously known to contain
       units mistakenly displayed the former units as still
       present/supported. GNA#22498
     * When the 'foggedborders' server option was enabled, border
       information was not included in map transfers between players.
       GNA#22497
     * Fix a server crash when paradropping. GNA#22391 GNA#22479
     * Fix a possible server crash when a diplomat is killed after bribing
       a unit. GNA#22762
     * Fix a possible assertion failure from autosettlers. GNA#22345
     * Fix some assertion failures when changing player (for instance in
       edit mode). GNA#19848
     * Fix bugs with taking AI players and entering/leaving AI or 'away'
       mode: GNA#22716 GNAPATCH#5046
          + Taking an AI player could leave the player with invalid tax
            rates.
          + Putting a player who'd previously been /away under full AI
            control could leave them with the conservative 'away' skill
            level rather than a proper AI skill level.
          + AI state was not set up and cleared correctly when changing
            '/away' mode. For the classic AI, this could lead to incorrect
            defense calculations.
          + 'autotoggle' and 'aitoggle' now work for barbarian players (as
            'away' did before). GNA#22724
     * Minor fixes to civ2civ3 ruleset corner cases:
          + You can no longer sell your Aqueduct after building a Sewer
            System and still have your city grow. GNA#22804
          + Triremes starting their turn in coastal river cities missed
            out on the Lighthouse move bonus. GNA#22438
          + Barbarian players without a capital no longer suffer crippling
            corruption and waste. GNA#22330
          + Prevent Transport units from performing land terrain
            improvements while in cities. GNA#22417
          + Ensure that cold war and related effects survive destruction
            of Apollo Program and/or Manhattan Project. GNA#22805
          + Treat Solar Plants as redundant with the Hoover Dam. GNA#22434
     * Fixes to the multiplayer ruleset:
          + Ensure notifications are sent out about new technologies
            gained from Philosophy or Darwin's Voyage. GNA#22783
            GNAPATCH#5355 GNAPATCH#5358 GNA#22827
     * In the classic and experimental rulesets, close a loophole where a
       Lighthouse and Port Facility together could yield hardened sea
       units. (This would have required a very unusual game.) GNA#22081
     * Prevent diplomacy with barbarian players in the civ1 and civ2
       rulesets (in civ1, it was possible to attempt treaty with pirates
       but not barbarians). GNA#22727 GNA#22728
     * Map generation fixes:
          + When map generation leads to a change in settings, announce
            the fallback settings afterwards. If multiple attempts are
            required to generate a map, reset these settings between each
            attempt. GNAPATCH#5180
          + The 'tilesperplayer' setting is now enacted more accurately.
            GNAPATCH#5187
          + Remove spurious assertion failures about MAP_MAX_LINEAR_SIZE
            when generating large maps. GNA#19429 GNA#22640
     * For the purposes of credit in the rank log, any user detaching from
       a player (even an observer) was resetting the username used for
       ranking. For now the ranking rules have been reverted to those used
       up until 2.3.2. GNA#22458
     * Fixes to voting:
          + Do not call votes which will immediately pass (for instance if
            a user is alone on a server). GNAPATCH#5181
          + Fix incorrect vote information displayed in a client which
            connects while a vote is in progress. GNA#22566
     * The 'surrender' command now does additional sanity checks.
       GNA#22622
     * Fix display of team names. GNA#22394
     * Silence some warnings when loading games saved with previous
       versions:
          + Spurious "City size and number of citizens does not match"
            warnings from 2.4 default ruleset games. GNA#22360
          + "Trying to put <number> into 8 bits" warnings from pre-2.3
            savegames. GNA#22364

Changes affecting other rulesets / modders

     * When upgrading a unit which has the NoVeteran flag (cannot gain
       veteran levels through experience), any existing veteran levels are
       no longer discarded. GNA#22425
     * The server now handles the case of a city being destroyed while
       being transferred (which is most likely to happen as a result of a
       Lua script). GNA#18191
     * If team_pooled_research is enabled, the tech_researched script
       signal is now sent to all players on a team, not just one of them.
       GNA#22474 GNAPATCH#5430 GNA#22782
     * Lua scripts can determine whether two players share research with
       the new (Player):shares_research() function. GNAPATCH#5408
     * Calling (Tile):has_base() in Lua with a nonexistent base name could
       crash the server. GNA#22341
     * Clients were not always kept up to date after a Lua script called
       (Tile):set_label(). GNA#19962
     * Extra sanity checking when loading rulesets. GNAPATCH#4972
     * Apply patch 2 to the included Lua 5.2.3. GNAPATCH#5307

Changes affecting server operators

     * On Unix, the server could fail to start again shortly after
       quitting, dying with "bind failed: Address already in use". This
       was a regression from 2.4. GNA#22702
     * Comments are now only accepted at the start of a server command
       line, allowing a '#' character to be entered in commands. GNA#16864
     * Servers built with support for multiple database backends could
       only use one of them. GNA#20723
     * The event cache can now store much more history. GNA#18742
     * Some of the settings in server scripts written by the '/write'
       command did not take effect, because the 'rulesetdir' command at
       the end was resetting settings set earlier in the script. GNA#22447
     * When the server was in edit mode, detached clients could receive
       unwanted packets and emit warnings. GNA#21468
     * Creating a player midgame (with /create or Lua script) didn't
       initialize city style and gender correctly. GNA#22832
     * The /create command now validates the AI type argument better.
       GNA#22697
     * When built without readline support, the server could stop
       accepting input after an empty line. GNA#18254
     * More robustness against loading invalid savegames. GNA#22523
       GNA#21327
     * Send more information to metaserver: nation flag tag
       (GNAPATCH#5199) and ruleset name (GNAPATCH#5229).

General

     * Numerous improvements to pathfinding, used for client goto and for
       the AI:
          + Units which will be unable to move next turn but still have
            move points this turn (for instance due to tech loss) are now
            handled correctly. (This could lead to premature nuclear
            explosion in rulesets where nuclear units require extra
            technology to move, such as civ2civ3.) GNA#22569
          + Fix some possible issues for units with more than one turn of
            fuel, such as bombers. GNAPATCH#4931
          + A collection of general fixes which, together with
            client-specific fixes, we hope will resolve a client crash
            observed on Windows (GNA#21774), and probably fix other bugs
            too. GNAPATCH#5190 GNA#22693 GNA#22756 GNA#22755
          + Other minor fixes and speed improvements. GNA#22636 GNA#21938
     * Already-built wonders are now dismissed when considering what
       players can ever build. This affects the client city UI and may
       also affect AI behavior. GNA#22667
     * Fix a bug which could cause strings to contain invalid/truncated
       UTF-8 sequences. GNA#22885
     * Fix/improve diagnostic messages in error cases, notably including
       network failures. GNA#22481 GNA#22503 GNA#22462 GNA#22706 GNA#22729
       GNA#22282 GNAPATCH#5371
     * Fix a possible crash when an --enable-debug build tried to print a
       very deep backtrace. GNA#22854
     * Some optimization for speed, particularly on the server, some as a
       result of profiling analysis. GNAPATCH#4933 GNAPATCH#5154
     * Memory savings and leak fixes. GNA#21552 GNA#22582 GNA#22583
       GNA#22586 GNA#22587 GNA#22584 GNA#22589 GNA#22590 GNA#22626
       GNA#22670 GNA#22627 GNA#22629 GNA#22630 GNA#22631 GNA#22632
       GNAPATCH#5123
     * Various internal changes which should only affect developers.
       GNAPATCH#5000 GNA#22413 GNAPATCH#5091 GNA#21543 GNAPATCH#5111
       GNAPATCH#5092 GNAPATCH#5144 GNAPATCH#5095 GNAPATCH#5167
       GNAPATCH#5120 GNAPATCH#5182 GNAPATCH#5267 GNA#22809 GNAPATCH#5381
       GNAPATCH#5298 GNA#22824 GNAPATCH#5192 GNAPATCH#5299 GNAPATCH#5297
       GNAPATCH#5296 GNA#22781 GNAPATCH#5411 GNAPATCH#5418 GNA#22955
       GNAPATCH#5127

AI

     * The AI can now take into account the defense value of existing
       bases when picking a site for a new city. GNA#22079
     * The AI now counts the pillaging of any fortress it owns against the
       responsible player, even if that caused it to lose the territory on
       which the fortress stood. GNA#22445
     * The AI was undervaluing units defined as good defenders in the
       ruleset, and overvaluing 'OK' defenders. GNA#22617
     * The AI was undervaluing cities in various ways for the purpose of
       diplomatic treaties. GNA#22436
     * The AI now considers the effect of the 'diplcost' setting when
       evaluating the value of a gold transfer clause in a treaty.
       GNAPATCH#5399
     * The AI's evaluation of improvement benefits was broken in the
       presence of effect clauses with zero value in the ruleset. (Should
       not affect most rulesets, but may sometimes occur when testing a
       new ruleset.) GNA#22363
     * Some fixes to the AI's evaluation of benefits in rulesets using
       negated requirements. Does not affect the supplied rulesets.
       GNA#22399
     * Fix some possible crashes with the threaded AI. GNA#22344
       GNAPATCH#5328
     * Allow threaded AI to be built in without classic AI. GNA#22529

Clients

     * The Qt client is now substantially complete, with many features
       added since beta1.
     * The Windows Gtk client is built against a different Gtk version,
       fixing major problems in East Asian locales, including inability to
       use the chatline and other text boxes, and failure to display the
       online help. GNA#21038 GNA#22067
     * Fix a longstanding bug in the Gtk client that could make it
       impossible to select a new government. GNA#18764
     * The client now supports loading a save file from the command line
       directly, with the --file command line option. GNAPATCH#3180
     * The 'Explode Nuclear' command is now more careful; previously, if
       the nuclear unit was unable to reach the specified destination (or
       move at all), it would explode regardless (this could happen due to
       'unitwaittime', due to another bug). Also, the command now supports
       setting waypoints. GNA#21934 GNA#22624 GNA#22722
     * Various fixes to client goto. (Some of these may resolve a client
       crash observed on Windows: GNA#21774.)
          + Ignore duplicate waypoints in client goto, and attempts to go
            nowhere. GNAPATCH#5271 GNAPATCH#5191 GNA#22610
          + Improve behaviour if a unit moves or is lost while the user is
            in the middle of specifying a goto. GNAPATCH#5193 GNA#22577
     * Fix client error messages when manipulating units with a zero move
       rate. GNA#22571
     * Some fixes to spy and caravan action dialogs:
          + Some buttons were active when the relevant action was not
            available. GNA#22565 GNA#22592 GNA#22593 GNA#22591
          + (Gtk) When multiple spy action dialogs were active at the same
            time, orders could end up being issued to the wrong unit.
            GNA#21636 GNA#22595
     * Fix a random client crash or error message after selecting 'Connect
       to Network Game'. GNA#22449 GNA#22316
     * Fix a cause of the client starting a server which it then could not
       connect to. GNA#22463
     * Fix error messages and possible instability when the city governor
       is working on a city that has been destroyed. GNA#16438
     * The client could report an incorrect ping time when the real time
       was not yet known. GNAPATCH#5349 GNA#22761
     * Fix some graphical glitches when moving units. GNA#19946 GNA#22770
     * Fix an error message when observing a player who is building a
       spaceship. GNA#22933
     * Map editor fixes and improvements:
          + Make it possible to select a nation for barbarian players.
            GNA#22741 Prevent setting normal players to barbarian and
            other unsuitable nations. GNA#22742
          + Players' research progress can now be edited. GNA#22840
          + Fix bugs in tile copy and paste:
               o Tiles were pasted in completely the wrong place.
                 GNA#21655
               o Copying units could cause assertion failures. GNA#22558
               o The client could remember possibly-invalid tiles from one
                 game to the next. GNA#22553
     * (Gtk) With the 'Help' box checked in the science dialog, technology
       help would pop up randomly at turn end and other times. GNA#19882
     * (Gtk) The apostrophe key now focuses the chatline in pregame (as it
       already did during play). GNA#22429 GNA#22453
     * (Gtk) Fix an assertion failure on quit after opening the Lua
       console. GNA#22431
     * (Gtk3) Clicking on specialists in the city dialog did the wrong
       thing. GNA#22366
     * (Gtk3) Fix a bug causing the chat window to be minimised after
       reconnecting, and assertion failures. GNA#21639 GNA#22673
     * (Gtk3) Various display issues:
          + Fix problems with flag display. GNA#21373 GNA#22457 GNA#22517
          + Fix fog-of-war in some tilesets. GNA#21601
          + Miscellaneous cosmetic tweaks. GNA#22671 GNA#22672
     * (SDL) The SDL client now supports changing nation sets.
       GNAPATCH#4351
     * (SDL) Fix client crash when attempting industrial sabotage of a
       city with no buildings. GNA#22495
     * (SDL) Don't prevent bases from being built on city center tiles in
       rulesets which allow this. GNA#22509
     * (SDL) Fix incorrect background color on some dialogs. GNA#22511

Tilesets / Art

     * The Cimpletoon tileset now includes graphics for the Migrant unit
       in the civ2civ3 ruleset. GNA#20029
     * The maglev graphics in the Amplio2 and Cimpletoon rulesets were
       never displayed. GNA#22371
     * Enable display of mines on water in all supplied tilesets, to
       support modpacks with different mining rules from the supplied
       rulesets. GNA#22424
     * Added a sound effect for an illegal server command to the standard
