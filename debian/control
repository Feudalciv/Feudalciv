Description: A free Civilization clone for Unix and X.

 implemented for X.  FreeCiv is a turn-based strategy game, in which
 each player becomes leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain
 the ultimate goal: The extinction of all other civilizations.

 FreeCiv recommends xaw-wrappers because it requires the original
 Xaw library and cannot work with replacements like xaw3d and nextaw.
 The xaw-wrappers package is necessary if you have such replacement
 libraries installed.
