freeciv (1.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Main package (freeciv) no longer contains a client, to get rid of
    superfulous dependencies; instead it Recommends: freeciv-client which is
    a virtual package Provided by the 2 client packages (3 for the CVS
    snapshots). The xaw client is moved to the freeciv-xaw package.
  * Fixed the xaw-wrappers incompatibility (xaw-wrappers changed its
    interface since the last Freeciv release, and this made freeciv-xaw
    incompatible)

    use debhelper.
  * Fixes #31907 (glitch in alternatives system when interfaced with xaw3d)

freeciv (1.7.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed lots of glitches in debianization of the new status quo:
    + We no longer need the "civ" script because we now set datadir in
      configure
    + Made "civ" into an alternative, to cope with future binary packages
      freeciv-xaw3d and freeciv-gtk
    + The menu entry for the client does not point to "civ" anymore but to
      "civclient"; changed the label to state that it's the "(traditional
      Athena version)"
    + Manually stripping binaries till I get around to rewrite debian/rules
      for debhelper
  * Notice: 1.7.2-1 wouldn't work at all, if you have it you need to upgrade
