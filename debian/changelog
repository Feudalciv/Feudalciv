freeciv (1.7.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed lots of glitches in debianization of the new status quo:
    + We no longer need the "civ" script because we now set datadir in
      configure
    + Made "civ" into an alternative, to cope with future binary packages
      freeciv-xaw3d and freeciv-gtk
    + The menu entry for the client does not point to "civ" anymore but to
      "civclient"; changed the label to state that it's the "(traditional
      Athena version)"
    + Manually stripping binaries till I get around to rewrite debian/rules
      for debhelper
  * Notice: 1.7.2-1 wouldn't work at all, if you have it you need to upgrade

    run without flags.
