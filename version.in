# Freeciv network capstring: see documentation in common/capstr.c
#
# +Freeciv.Devel.YYYY.MMM.DD is the base capability string.
#
#   - No new mandatory capabilities can be added to the release branch; doing
#     so would break network capability of supposedly "compatible" releases.
#
#   - Avoid adding a new mandatory capability to the development branch for
#     as long as possible.  We want to maintain network compatibility with
#     the stable branch for as long as possible.
