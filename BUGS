BUGS
====

Freeciv 1.8.1 is a "stable" release and is considered bug-free enough 
for everyday use.  However if you do find a bug, we would really like to 
know, so that we can fix it.  This file lists known bugs in this release, 
and gives information about reporting new bugs.

KNOWN BUGS:
===========

 - The Gtk+ client sometimes has a problem where the focus gets stuck
   on the chatline, and the arrow keys no longer work to move units in
   the main window.  A way to get back to the main window is to use
   the <Tab> key to advance to focus to some other widget.  Then the
   arrow keys will work again.  (Notably, clicking on the main window
   does *not* give it the focus, unfortunately.)

 - The easy AI is not easy enough for novice players.  If the AI is 
   beating you up early in the game, try setting the "generator" server 
   option to 2 or 3.  That is, in the server, before starting a game,
   type:  set generator 2
   or:    set generator 3

 - The hard AI is not hard enough for very experienced players, and 
   still does some stupid things.  Eg, it prefers leaving cities in 
   revolt rather than letting them starve/shrink.

 - If you scroll to the bottom of the map, sometimes the bottom row
   of squares is not fully visible.  As a work-around, try adjusting
   the size of the client window.

 - Sometimes there may be too many advances in the "goal" menu of
   the science report, such that the menu goes off the bottom of the
   screen and you cannot select some items.

 - Spies and diplomat special actions cannot be used when using "goto".
   (You will get a message "can't attack".)  You must move the spy or
   diplomat (at least the last move, into the enemy) using the arrow 
   keys instead of the "goto" command.

 - The server truncates the display of very long hostnames.

 - Units on goto can attack enemy units and cities unintentionally.

 - When a unit is moved to the edge of the map display, the map should 
   shift sooner, before the unit actually gets to the edge.

 - The Great Wall wonder, which acts as a city wall in every city,
   disallows cities to build "proper" city walls that won't disappear 
   when wonder becomes obsolete.

REPORTING A BUG:
================

Here's what to do:

 - Check that it is not one of the known bugs listed above!  :-)

 - Check the Freeciv website, to ensure you're playing the latest
   version.  (We may have already fixed the problem.)

   In particular, you might like to try a development snapshot,
   from our CVS repository.  You can FTP them from:
        <http://www.freeciv.org/latest.html>

 - Check the Freeciv FAQ on the Freeciv website to see if we've
   published a way to work around your bug.

 - Check the Freeciv Bug Tracking System at:
        <http://www.freeciv.org/cgi-bin/bugs>
   to see if the bug has already been reported.

 - Submit a bug report!  

   You can submit a bug report either by sending email to 
   <bugs@cvs.freeciv.org>, or via the web at
   <http://www.freeciv.org/cgi-bin/bugs>.

   Or, if you want to send the Freeciv developers some comments 
   but don't want to lodge a bug report, you can sent email to 
   <freeciv-dev@freeciv.org>, the Freeciv developer's mailing list.

   What to include in your bug report:

   - Describe the problem, including any messages that were displayed.

   - Tell us the name and version of:

       - The Operating System you're using.  You may find the
         "uname -a" command useful.

       - The version number of Freeciv.

       - If you are using the Gtk+ client, the versions numbers
         (if you know them) of your Gtk+, glib, and imlib libraries.

       - If you are using the Xaw client, the version numbers (if you
         know them) of the X libraries, the Xpm library, and the Xaw 
         library, and particularly whether it is standard Xaw, or a 
	 variant such as Xaw3d, Xaw95, or Nextaw.

       - If you're compiling from source code, the name
         and version number of the compiler.

       - If you're installing from a binary package, the name of
         the package, the distribution it's for, and where you
         got it from.

   - If Freeciv "dumps core", then we may ask you to use a debugger to
   give us a "stack trace".  You'll need the "core" file for this, so
   please hold onto it for a while.
