Freeciv Nation Rulesets and Flags
===========================================================================

This file describes the contents of the nation files. This is intended as 
developer reference, and for people wanting to create/compile alternative 
nation files for Freeciv. A nation consists of a nation file in the 
rulesets and a flag in the tilesets. 

The contents of this file is based on this page from the Freeciv wiki:

How to add a Nation:
--------------------

To add a nation of your own, you should look at the following files:

data/nation/<nationname>.ruleset

  This is the new nation, which you will have to create. It may help to
  copy one of the other nation files over and edit it. See below for a
  style guide for nation files.
  - The <nationname> bit is to be replaced with the nations name (duh).
  Please don't use whitespacees and special characters. Underlines are
  ok though.
  - The name should be the same as the name of the nation inside the
  ruleset file.
  - The file must be encoded in Unicode.

data/default/nations.ruleset

  This lists all nation files. Add your nation
  (data/nation/<nationname>.ruleset) to this list.

data/flags/* 

  This is the flags directory. You will have to add a flag-file
  (see below) for your nation to work (see below).

data/scenario/* 

  You can add starting position for your nation on a scenario map.

Before a nation can be included in the main distribution, the following
files will also have to be edited. Unless you know what you're doing you
shouldn't need to worry about this.

data/nation/Makefile.am 

  Another list of nation files - add your nation (<nationname>.ruleset)
  to this list.

data/flags/Makefile.am 

  Another list of flag files - add your flag to this list.

po/POTFILES.in 

  Here is yet another list of nations files; again add your nation
  (data/nation/<nationname>.ruleset) to it.

How to add a Flag:
------------------

Overview
========

Please note that Freeciv no longer uses XPM files. PNG is the preferred
form for graphics, and flags should be made exclusively in SVG. 

A new nation needs a new flag. As of Freeciv 2.1 all flags are stored 
in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. Sodipodi and Inkscape are 
two good SVG editors. If you are creating a real-world nation you can 
probably find a Free or public domain flag that can be used. One good 
place to look is the Open Clip Art Library (OCAL.) Remember that any flags 
we add must be licenced under the GPL and should be attributed to their 
original author, so make a note of where you found the flag, what its 
licence is, and who made it.

We also welcome improvements to existing flags. Most of our existing 
flags come from the Sodipodi clipart collection, and some of them are 
less than perfect. One common problem is that the colors are wrong. If 
you fix a flag for a real nation be sure to cite your source so we can 
be sure it's accurate. Good sources for nation flag data are Wikipedia 
or Flags Of The World.

If you want to add or improve a flag for a fantasy nation, this is also 
welcome. We recommend you first contact the original author of the flag 
(see the CREDITS file) to discuss your ideas for changes.


Flag Guidelines
===============

Here are a few guidelines for flags:

  - Flags should be rectangles, since an outline is added to them
  automatically.
  - Flags often come in multiple aspect ratios. A 3:2 ratio looks best 
  for Freeciv and currently every flag has this ratio. For a flag that 
  is "supposed" to be 2:1 or 4:3, you can often find a 3:2 version 
  as well.


Flag Specifics
==============

To add a flag you'll have to edit the following files:

data/flags/<flagname>.svg 

  Here is the SVG flag image. This is not used directly by Freeciv but 
  is  rendered into PNG files (at various resolutions for different 
  tilesets). The SVG file is not used in Freeciv 2.0 but all the other 
  steps for adding flags are the same.
  - The <flagname> should either be the name of the country that represents
  the flag, or the common name for the actual flag. When in doubt, use the
  same name as the name of the nation.

data/flags/<flagname>.png

data/flags/<flagname>-shield.png 

  These are the flag images that are used by Freeciv. They are rendered
  from the SVG file. Once this file has been created it can be used with
  older versions of Freeciv as well. To run the conversion program you
  will need to install Inkscape, ImageMagick, and (optionally) pngquant.
  Once these are installed change to the data/flags directory and run
  ./convert_png <nationname>.svg.

data/misc/flags.spec 

  This file has a reference to the flag PNG graphic. The "tag" here must
  match the flag tag you put in the nation ruleset file
  (usually f.<flagname>, and the "file" should point to the PNG image at
  flags/<flagname>.png.

data/misc/shields.spec 

  Just like flags.spec, this file must include a reference to the flag
  PNG graphic. The only difference is that the file should point to the
  "shield" graphic, flags/<flagname>-shield.png.

Changes to the .spec files can be submitted as a patch (created using 
diff -ruN). Even though the *.spec files may need to be changed, please 
include them in the diff -- this should be easier for you, and it 
provides a convenient place for us to grab the sprite name. See the 
section on How to Contribute in the Freeciv wiki for more instructions.

Contents and Style:
-------------------

What nations can be added to Freeciv?
=====================================

Freeciv supports a classification of nations in an unlimited number of 
groups. We currently have Ancient, Medieval, Modern, African, American, 
Asian, European, Oceanian and Fictional groups. Modern nations are 
existing (independent) states; ancient and medieval nations should have 
had an independent dynasty or state in ancient or medieval times,
respectively; fictional nations are those that are products of the 
fantasy of an author. When adding fictional nations, you must make 
sure names and flags are copyrighted in a GPL-compatible way.

A nation should be added to at least one relevant group, preferably 
two or more if appropriate.


Nation naming
=============

The default name of the nation should be the name of the people, 
country or empire in English, adjective form. For example, the nations 
of ancient Babylon is called "Babylonian" in Freeciv. The plural form 
should be standard English as well, for example plural for the Polish 
nation is "Poles" in Freeciv. Use only English ascii for nation names.


Conflicting nations
===================

To specify one or more nations that the AI shouldn't pick for the same 
game, use this syntax:

	conflicts_with="<nationname>", "<nationname>", ...

You only have to specify this in the nation you're adding, since it 
works in both directions. Reasons for conflicting nations could be 
either that they represent the same people in different eras 
(ex: Roman - Italian) or that the two nations have too similar 
flags that they are easily mixed up in the game 
(ex: Russian - Serbian.)


Civil war nations
=================

Specify one or more civil war nations. When a player's capital is 
captured, that player might suffer a civil war where his or her 
nation is divided and a new player created. The nation for this new 
player is selected from one of the civil war nations specified in the
ruleset. A civil war nation should be linguistically, geographically 
and/or historically related to the current nation. A linguistic 
relation is especially important, since city names after a nation 
run out of their own city names, are selected from the civil war 
nations' city lists.


Legend
======

A legend is required in a nation ruleset. The legend can be a 
summarized history of the nation, or just a piece of trivia. 
Only English ascii can be used in legends.


Leaders
=======

A leader should have a strong historical relation to the nation 
you create. Try keeping to clearly political (e.g. not cultural, 
athletes etc) leaders. In addition, a leader should be representative 
of the entire nation, no clearly regional/provincial ones. In short, 
list Great Leaders(tm) only. :-) (We gladly make concessions from 
these rules in order to get any female names on the list; also for 
non-sovereign nations.)

An ideal leader list would consist of at least five, but not 
many more than ten names. Avoid listing any person currently in
office as the leader of his/her nation.

Leaders should be written in its native - not Anglicized - form: 
For example "Karl XII" instead of "Charles XII" for the 
Swedish king. The exception to this rule is when an (ancient) 
leader is commonly known under one name, to which the "native" or 
more correct name is more or less unintelligible. An example is 
the Egyptian Pharaoh "Cheops" more correctly spelled "Khufu." Common 
sense has to be used in these cases.

Be as specific as possible. A relatively modern leader should 
be mentioned with both first and last name. Kings should be marked 
with an appropriate succession number, using Roman numerals. 
(Ex: Elizabeth II) Please keep to standard English formatting: 
Not German (Otto II.), Hungarian (IV. BÃ©la) or Danish (Valdemar 4.) 
etc.

Leader names support any Unicode character, but please keep to 
Latin letters.

For consistency and readability, put only one leader per line. 
Feel free to provide a hint of the leader's identity or a brief 
background in a comment beside any leader: This information might 
be used at a later stage.

Leader titles may be specified in a separate tag. One title for 
each government type (including Despotism and Anarchy) as well as 
sex may be provided. Only English ascii can be used in leader 
titles.


Flag
====

You should provide a unique flag for your nation. Using a flag that 
is already used by another nation in the game is not acceptable.

An alternative flag does not have to be specified.


City style
==========

A nation must specify a default city style. The available city styles 
depends on the tileset used. Practically every tileset have four city 
styles: "European", "Classical" (Roman style), "Asian" (Pagoda style) 
and "Tropical" (African or Polynesian style). In Amplio tileset, 
"Babylonian" and "Celtic" are also available. If the tileset used by 
a client does not support a particular city style, a fallback style is 
used. Selecting a style for your nation is not that strict. Just try 
to keep it "realistic."


City list
=========

As for the list of city names, you should make a clear decision about 
the group of a nation you add. A modern nation must be restricted on 
the actual today's territory; you should leave out any cities not on 
this territory. 

The reason for this is, we don't want Freeciv to be used as a political 
vehicle for discussions about the borders or independence of nations 
and avoid trouble with other ruleset authors.

A city should appear in its native form, not Anglicized. For example, 
the Danish capital should be named "KÃ¸benhavn" and not "Copenhagen." 
However, please stick to Latin letters and when transcribing from a 
foreign writing system, try to avoid unnecessary accents.

The ordering of cities should take both chronology of founding and 
overall historical importance into consideration. Note that a city 
earlier in the list has a higher chance of being chosen than later 
cities.

A discussion of city ordering appears in the freeciv-dev archive:
  http://arch.freeciv.org/freeciv-dev-199910/msg00030.html 

There is even a perl script available to do the job in the same thread:
  http://arch.freeciv.org/freeciv-dev-199910/msg00074.html 


Natural city names
==================

Freeciv supports "natural" geographic placements of cities.

Cities can be labeled as matching or not matching a particular
type of terrain, which will make them more (or less) likely to
show up as the "default" name. The exact format of the list
entry is

	"<cityname> (<label>, <label>, ...)"

where the cityname is just the name for the city (note that it
may not contain quotes or parenthesis), and each "label" matches
(case-insensitive) a terrain type for the city (or "river"), with a
preceeding ! to negate it. The terrain list is optional, of course,
so the entry can just contain the cityname if desired. A city name
labeled as matching a terrain type will match a particular map
location if that map location is on or adjacent to a tile of the named
terrain type; in the case of the "river" label (which is a special
case) only the map location itself is considered. A complex example:

  "Wilmington (ocean, river, swamp, forest, !hills, !mountains, !desert)"

will cause the city of Wilmington to match ocean, river, swamp, and
forest tiles while rejecting hills, mountains, and deserts. Although
this degree of detail is probably unnecessary to achieve the desired
effect, the system is designed to degrade smoothly so it should work
just fine.

(A note on scale: it might be tempting to label London as !ocean, i.e.
not adjacent to an ocean.  However, on a reasonably-sized FreeCiv world
map, London will be adjacent to the ocean; labeling it !ocean will tend
to give bad results. This is a limitation of the system, and should be
taken into account when labelling cities.)

At this point, it is useful to put one city per line, only.

Finally, don't forget to leave a blank line feed in the end of your nation
ruleset.
