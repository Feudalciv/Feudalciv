/* Capabilities: original author: Mitch Davis (mjd@alphalink.com.au)
 *
 * The capability string is a string clients and servers trade to find
 * out if they can talk to each other, and using which protocol version,
 * and which features and behaviors to expect.  The string is a list of
 * words, separated by whitespace and/or commas, where each word indicates
 * a capability that this version of Freeciv understands.
 * If a capability word is mandatory, it should start with a "+".
 *
 * eg, #define CAPABILITY "+1.6, MapScroll, +AutoSettlers"
 *
 * Client and server functions can test these strings for a particular
 * capability by calling the functions in capability.c
 *
 * Each executable has a string our_capability (above), which gives the
 * capabilities of the running executable.  This is normally initialised
 * with CAPABILITY, but can be changed at run-time by setting the
 * FREECIV_CAPS environment variable, though that is probably mainly
 * useful for testing purposes.
 *
 * For checking the connections of other executables, each
 * "struct connection" has a capability string, which gives the
 * capability of the executable at the other end of the connection.
 * So for the client, the capability of the server is in
 * aconnection.capability, and for the server, the capabilities of 
 * connected clients are in game.players[i]->conn.capability
 * The client now also knows the capabilities of other clients,
 * via game.players[i]->conn.capability.
 *
 * Note the connection struct is a parameter to the functions to send and
 * receive packets, which may be convenient for adjusting how a packet is
 * sent or interpreted based on the capabilities of the connection.
 *
 * At the time of a major release, the capability string may be
 * simplified; eg, the example string above could be replaced by "+1.7".
 * (This should probably only happen if a mandatory capability has
 * been introduced since the previous release.)
 * Whoever makes such a change has responsibility to search the Freeciv
 * code, and look for places where people are using has_capability.
 * If you're taking a capability out of the string, because now every
 * client and server supports it, then you should take out the
 * if(has_capability()) code so that this code is always executed.
 *
 * (The savefile and ruleset files have strings which are used similarly,
 * and checked by the same has_capability function, but the strings there
 * are not directly related to the capability strings discussed here.)

/* "+1.14.delta" is the new delta protocol for 1.14.0-dev.

 * in determining penalties when switching production.
 *
 * "orders" means client orders is used for client-side goto and patrol.
 *
 * "veteran" means the extended veteran system.
 *
 * "starter" means the Starter terrain flag is supported.
 *
 * "union" is team research ability
 *
 * "iso_maps" means iso-maps are supported by both server and client!
 *
 * "orders2client" means that the server sends back the orders to the client.
 *
 * "change_production" is the E_CITY_PRODUCTION_CHANGED event.

 * "tilespec1" means changed graphic strings in terrain.ruleset.

 * "no_earth" means that the map.is_earth value is gone; replaced by
 * ptile->spec_sprite
 *
 * "trans" means that the transported_by field is sent to the client.
 *
 * "want_hack" means that the client is capable of asking for hack properly.
 * 
 * "invasions" means ground units moving from ocean to land now lose all
 * their movement; changable by ruleset option.
