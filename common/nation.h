 * The city_name structure holds information about a default choice for
 * the city name.  The "name" field is, of course, just the name for
 * the city.  The "river" and "terrain" fields are entries recording
 * whether the terrain is present near the city - we give higher priority
 * to cities which have matching terrain.  In the case of a river we only
 * care if the city is _on_ the river, for other terrain features we give
 * the bonus if the city is close to the terrain.  Both of these entries
 * may hold a value of 0 (no preference), 1 (city likes the terrain), or -1
 * (city doesn't like the terrain).
 *
 * This is controlled through the nation's ruleset like this:
 *   cities = "Washington (ocean, river, swamp)", "New York (!mountains)"
