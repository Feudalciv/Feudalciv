* What is toLuaxx?
  toLuaxx is an extension of toLua and toLua++, a tool to integrate
  C/C++ code with Lua. toLuaxx includes new features oriented to C++,
  such as class templates, operators compitable with lua.

  toluaxx is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++
  code with Lua. Based on a "cleaned" header file, toluaxx automatically
  generates the binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using
  Lua-5.1 API and metamethod facilities, the current version automatically
  maps C/C++ constants, external variables, functions, operators,
  namespace, classes, and methods to Lua. It also provides facilities to 
  create Lua modules.
