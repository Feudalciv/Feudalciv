  Freeze the workers (citizens on tiles) for the city.  They will not be
  auto-arranged until unfreeze_workers is called.

  Long explanation:

  Historically auto_arrange_workers was called every time a city changed.
  If the city grew or shrunk, a new tile became available or was removed,
  the function would be called.  However in at least one place this breaks.
  In some operations (like transfer_city) multiple things may change and
  the city is not left in a sane state in between.  Calling
  auto_arrange_workers after each change means it's called with an "insane"
  city.  This can lead at best to a failed sanity check with a wasted call,
  or at worse to a more major bug.  The solution is freeze_workers and
  thaw_workers.

  Call freeze_workers to freeze the auto-arranging of citizens.  So long as
  the freeze is in place no arrangement will be done for this city.  Any
  call to auto_arrange_workers will just queue up an arrangement for later.
  Later when thaw_workers is called, the freeze is removed and the
  auto-arrange will be done if there is any arrangement pending.

  Freezing may safely be done more than once.

  It is thus always safe to call freeze and thaw around any set of city
  actions.  However this is unlikely to be needed in very many places.
