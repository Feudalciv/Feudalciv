Wed Sep  2 20:37:06 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* CREDITS, configure, configure.in, client/Freeciv.h,
 	common/shared.h, data/Freeciv: Bumped version numbers to 1.7.1.
	
Wed Sep  2 20:12:32 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* NEWS, configure, configure.in: With this patch to configure.in
 	freeciv will actually configure and compile nicely on Solaris (run
 	"autoconf" after applying this patch to make a new configure):
	
	Note that according to Johannes Abt
 	<jsabt@cip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de>, This works with
 	autoconf-2.12 but not autoconf-2.9.
	
	Patch supplied by Finn Arne Gangstad <finnag@guardian.no>.
	
Wed Sep  2 19:57:40 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* common/unit.c: This patch prevents settlers from fortifying, in
 	order to reduce the confusion between fortifying and building
 	fortresses.  Patch supplied by David Pfitzner <dwp@mso.anu.edu.au>.
	
Wed Sep  2 00:54:52 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* data/Freeciv, client/Freeciv.h: Changed the layout of the
 	diplomat and spy dialogs so the buttons are in a two column list
 	instead of one big long row.  Buttons are now the same size with
 	centered labels, which looks nicer IMHO.
	
Tue Sep  1 22:08:02 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/civclient.c, common/game.c, server/civserver.c: Bug fix
 	from Walter Misar to fix alignment problems on solaris with the
 	used_ids array.
	
Tue Sep  1 21:57:57 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/dialogs.c: Diplomats bribing units wasn't done right.
	
Tue Sep  1 21:56:36 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* common/unit.c: diplomat_can_do_action() was letting non-spies
 	sabotage units.
	
Tue Sep  1 14:34:49 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gotohand.c: Dealing with GOTOing warships more
 	intelligently re: enemies_at. -- Syela
	
Tue Sep  1 14:32:38 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.c: Ignoring units at (i,j) for enemies_at(punit,
 	i, j).  -- Syela
	
Mon Aug 31 13:12:12 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/repodlgs.c: The "Income" line in the trade report will try
 	to approximate what your true income will be at the end of the
 	turn.  This means it will not be affected by buying or selling
 	things.  City improvements which will be completed at the end of
 	the turn can throw things off.
	
Mon Aug 31 12:59:46 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/unithand.c: Added buffering around the data sent when a
 	trade route is established.
	
Mon Aug 31 12:57:46 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/plrhand.c: Made changing tax rates do a gobal city
 	refresh.  This way the client gets instant feedback on how the new
 	rates effect his cities.
	
Mon Aug 31 12:54:33 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/cityturn.c: Buffered the connection during a global city
 	refresh.
	
Mon Aug 31 09:23:23 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/repodlgs.c: Fixed bug were the client would crash trying
 	to update the city report when it didn't exist.
	
Sat Aug 29 13:18:58 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/Freeciv.h, client/citydlg.c, client/repodlgs.c,
 	client/repodlgs.h, data/Freeciv: Changed the city report code so
 	that the whole report isn't generated when a single city is
 	changed.  Changed the way the widgets resize themselves to get
 	around broken Xt annoyingness so the labels should be centered and
 	the right size now.  There should also be less flickering when the
 	report is updated.
	
Sat Aug 29 13:09:43 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* common/packets.h: The improvements and city_map where called
 	unsigned char, but they really should be just plain char.
	
Sat Aug 29 13:08:35 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/stdinhand.c: Took out a comma where there shouldn't have
 	been one.
	
Fri Aug 28 10:36:54 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unithand.c: Fixing auto-explorers (I broke them yesterday)
 	-- Syela
	
Thu Aug 27 09:58:41 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unithand.c: Returning 0 for same_pos
 	handle_unit_move_requests (which often happen when the server
 	hangs) so movement isn't wasted.  Making the check for ai
 	ferryboats that try to attack much more robust to prevent aberrant
 	abort()s.  Allowing 0-move explorers to change acitivity. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 27 09:56:52 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/civserver.c, server/stdinhand.c, server/stdinhand.h:
 	Proto'ing set_ai_level and setting game.skill_level concurrently --
 	Syela
	
Thu Aug 27 09:56:05 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/settlers.c: Fixing stupid bug involving auto-settlers and
 	polar cities. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 27 09:55:22 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityhand.c: Adding city name to city_sell message (for AI
 	debugging) -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 27 09:54:44 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/mapctrl.c: Allowing players to idle 0-movement explorers
 	by clicking on them. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 27 09:48:08 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Not assuming walls for cities 2-3 turns away unless
 	owner knows Masonry. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 27 09:47:00 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aihand.c: Two bugfixes suggested by Peter Schaefer; preventing
 	the AI from setting lux=100 and selling buildings, and preventing
 	extremely high lux rates (for celebrations) that will lead to
 	selling buildings. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 27 09:45:57 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advmilitary.c: Preventing the AI from buying walls/coastal
 	unless it's urgent.  Not assuming walls until c == 4 if enemy
 	doesn't know masonry.  Adding port_is_within to prevent the AI from
 	building too many ports and warships; this way saves money and also
 	ensures enough ground troops for invasions. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 27 09:43:27 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* README.AI: Updated README.AI; recently fixed problems not
 	included. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 27 09:35:04 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/Freeciv.h, client/mapview.c, client/xmain.c, data/Freeciv:
 	Made the map canvas fill up all the space.  Before, if you had a
 	map with ysize>40 the canvas would have a big gap between the
 	scroll bar and the message window.
	
Wed Aug 26 22:57:43 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* data/Freeciv, client/Freeciv.h, client/gotodlg.c: Added a "All
 	Cities" toggle to the goto dialog.  Default is off.  This way the
 	dialog isn't full of hundreds of enemy cities.  Makes airlift much
 	less of a pain, since it doesn't take as long to find your city.
	
Wed Aug 26 22:54:53 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Fixed up do_airline() some.  It now uses
 	unit_can_airlift_to() to determine if an airlift is possible rather
 	than duplicating the code.  It also wasn't sending city updates for
 	the cities involved, so the client wouldn't know that a city had
 	already airlifted this turn.  Added buffering around the four
 	packets an airlift sends.
	
Wed Aug 26 00:05:23 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/citydlg.c: De-activated the activate button on diplomat
 	investigate city dialogs.
	
Tue Aug 25 22:53:25 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/repodlgs.c, client/repodlgs.h: Added in Cedric Tefft's
 	scrollbar for the city report patch.  Added code for turning of
 	report updates at the end of the turn.
	
Tue Aug 25 22:49:16 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/packhand.c: Made handle_unit_info() smarter about
 	refreshing city dialogs.  For instance, moving a unit out of its
 	homecity would refresh the city dialog twice.  Made the client turn
 	off report updates between during the end of the turn.  This
 	removes the flash in the reports as they would get updates hundreds
 	(or thousands!) of times.
	
Tue Aug 25 22:44:08 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/citydlg.c: The city_dialog_refresh() function had a hack
 	to update the city and trade reports when it was called.  However,
 	this function gets called for things relating to enemy cities that
 	don't show up in the reports.  So I made it only update the reports
 	for when it's called for the players own cities.  This greatly
 	reduces the number of costly city report refreshes the client does.
	
Tue Aug 25 22:41:10 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/Freeciv.h, data/Freeciv: Added in Cedric Tefft's patch for
 	a scrollbar on the city report.
	
Tue Aug 25 22:39:50 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/cityhand.c: Fixed a bug where nocity_send wasn't taking
 	effect.  This resulted in two city updates being sent at the end of
 	the turn for each of your cities.  Now it's down to one.
	
Tue Aug 25 09:15:27 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/civserver.c: Moving before_end_year (which does nothing
 	but reset message windows) closer to the end_of_sniff to make David
 	Pfitzner happy. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug 25 09:10:55 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/stdinhand.c: Applying David P's fix to the recently broken
 	set_ai_level -- Syela
	
Tue Aug 25 09:10:21 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/citydlg.c, client/packhand.c: Made the city dialogs get
 	updated when a unit listed in one (present or supported) changes
 	status.
	
Tue Aug 25 09:08:38 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/mapgen.c: Initializing counter j in mapgenerator2 and
 	3. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug 25 09:07:44 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unithand.c: Removing unneeded duplicate def'n of punit in
 	wakeup_neighbour -- Syela
	
Tue Aug 25 08:46:13 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* data/Freeciv, client/Freeciv.h, client/citydlg.c: Added an
 	"Activate Units" button to the city dialog that will activate all
 	units in the city.
	
Tue Aug 25 08:23:35 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/repodlgs.c: The trade report sell command won't try to
 	sell improvements in cities that already sold something that turn.
	
Mon Aug 24 23:40:24 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* server/unithand.c: Added code so that sentried units get woken up
 	when enemy units come within view.  Patch submitted by Trevor
 	Pering <pering@tongass.EECS.Berkeley.EDU>.
	
Mon Aug 24 23:32:48 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* server/stdinhand.c: This patch forces AI names to be between 1
 	and 9 chars long.  I chose 9 chars because it seems to be length
 	you are allowed to use for a human player.  Patch submitted by
 	Markus Linnala <maage@cs.tut.fi>.
	
Mon Aug 24 21:12:37 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/registry.c: Added code to align the pointer returned by
 	strbuffermalloc().
	
Mon Aug 24 10:39:24 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/cityhand.c: Nothing much really.
	
Sun Aug 23 23:43:04 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* client/Freeciv.h, client/civclient.c, client/optiondlg.c,
 	client/packhand.c, data/Freeciv, data/helpdata.txt: This patch
 	fixes problems with the original wakeup code.  (Eg, data/Freeciv
 	was only partly patched!)  Patch submitted by Reinier Post
 	<reinpost@win.tue.nl>.
	
Sun Aug 23 23:40:10 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* server/stdinhand.c: Modified the help string for map.seed so it
 	mentions that 0 gives a random map.  Patch submitted by Reinier
 	Post <reinpost@win.tue.nl>.
	
Sun Aug 23 23:31:27 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* common/map.h, server/mapgen.c: I took a look at the map generator
 	and reduced the chance it will hang up, so that it may work with
 	much more settings.
	
	While I was at it, I added an experimental generator 3, which will
 	create 1 big island for every player, and 1 small island.  Settings
 	for landmass will affect the changed mapgen 2.  Settings for
 	mountains, etc, won't yet.
	
	Patch submitted by Peter Schaefer
 	<schaefer@malaga.math.uni-augsburg.de>
	
Sun Aug 23 23:29:35 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* common/game.c, common/game.h, common/map.h, server/plrhand.c,
 	server/stdinhand.c: Attached is a small patch that fixes a bug in
 	the scorelog generation code... I screwed up the starting year (I
 	used 4000 instead of -4000)...  I made that number a constant in an
 	include file.  (Affects game.c, game.h, map.h, and plrhand.c).
  	Patch submitted by Trevor Pering
 	<pering@tongass.EECS.Berkeley.EDU>.
	
Sun Aug 23 23:27:17 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* client/civclient.c, client/clinet.c, client/colors.c,
 	client/graphics.c, client/helpdlg.c, client/packhand.c,
 	client/xmain.c, common/log.c, common/log.h, common/packets.c,
 	common/unit.c, server/cityhand.c, server/civserver.c,
 	server/maphand.c, server/registry.c, server/sernet.c,
 	server/stdinhand.c, server/unitfunc.c: Changed all occurances of
 	"log()" to "flog()", since the GTK port of Freeciv needs the -lm
 	math library, which also has a log() function.  Patch submitted by
 	Per I. Mathisen <perrin@kvalito.no>.
	
Fri Aug 21 21:00:37 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/stdinhand.c: The section file wasn't getting freed after a
 	manual save game.
	
Fri Aug 21 20:57:04 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/registry.c, server/registry.h: Fixed a bug I had added
 	earlier where the strbuffer would get freed when it hadn't been
 	allocated during an auto save game.  Used the opportunity to have
 	the rest of the registry allocations use the strbuffer system,
 	which reduced memory usage by another 200k for a big saved game.
	
Fri Aug 21 20:49:39 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* common/shared.c, common/shared.h: Removed the minstrdup()
 	function and put it into registry.c, since that is the only place
 	that used it.  Also changed it to use the strbuffer system.
	
Fri Aug 21 20:34:08 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/civserver.c, server/diplhand.c, server/gamehand.c,
 	server/gamehand.h, server/maphand.c, server/maphand.h,
 	server/plrhand.c, server/plrhand.h: Fixed some ugliness with the
 	includes.
	
Fri Aug 21 08:17:50 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/settlers.c: Not letting auto-settlers go idle as easily.
  	Christopher Neufeld's ideas, but my own implementation thereof. --
 	Syela
	
Thu Aug 20 23:18:06 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* common/city.c, server/plrhand.c: The attached patch makes the
 	Literacy field of the Demographics report less likely to overflow
 	(eg at the end of a large game).  Patch submitted by David Pfitzner
 	<dwp@mso.anu.edu.au>.
	
Thu Aug 20 21:46:04 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/plrhand.c, server/registry.c, server/registry.h: David
 	Pfitzner's patch to handle new savefile entries, which also handles
 	the foulness issue much better than my (non-uploaded) kluge. --
 	Syela
	
Thu Aug 20 21:44:23 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/citydlg.c, client/dialogs.c, client/packhand.c,
 	common/city.h, common/packets.c, server/cityhand.c,
 	server/plrhand.c, server/unitfunc.c: Reimplementing
 	diplomat_investigate in a less obtrusive way that does not hose
 	compatibility with 1.7.0.  Making create_advances_list more robust
 	and fixing a lot of other warnings in the spy and scorelog patches.
  	Adding savefile_options to player_load, but not using it. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 20 21:37:55 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/connectdlg.c: Changing an #if to an if() so that -Wall is
 	happy. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 20 21:31:10 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Fixing a typo in kill_unit that apparently
 	crashed the server. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 20 11:52:45 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/registry.c: Small change to hash function that decreases
 	collisions by 50% for huge save files.  Made a custom string
 	allocation function for the strings used by the section file loader
 	and the hash table.  This avoids malloc overhead on each string and
 	avoids having to iterate over all the hash table buckets to free
 	them.  This decreased load time by %17 and reduced the server's
 	memory usage by 804k.
	
Thu Aug 20 11:17:24 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/civserver.c, server/gamehand.c: Moved the load timing
 	stuff from gamehand to civserver.  This way it can time the whole
 	loading process, including hash table creation.  Also used clock()
 	instead of time() to get CPU time in clock ticks for more accuracy.
	
Thu Aug 20 05:24:31 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Fixing one of those SIGFPE's I love so very much
 	(in is_my_turn) -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 20 04:20:10 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/civserver.c: Added a function prototype for
 	read_init_script().
	
Wed Aug 19 23:48:20 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* server/gamehand.c, server/registry.c, server/registry.h: The
 	attached patch adds a hash table to the registry to speed up
 	lookups -- to speed up loading the savefile.  (The current method
 	is O(N^2) where N is the "size" of the savefile; this patch should
 	make it more like O(N).)  Patch submitted by David Pfitzner
 	<dwp@mso.anu.edu.au>.
	
Wed Aug 19 23:35:10 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* client/Freeciv.h, client/mapctrl.c, client/mapctrl.h,
 	client/menu.c, client/packhand.c, client/xmain.c, data/Freeciv:
 	Added a 'wakeup' command (W for a unit - shift/click on tile) to
 	unsentry all units on a given tile.  Patch submitted by Reinier
 	Post <reinpost@win.tue.nl>.
	
Wed Aug 19 23:27:43 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* server/civserver.c: Added an '-r' option to the server, which
 	will read in an initilization script at server startup time.  Patch
 	submitted by Trevor Pering <pering@tongass.EECS.Berkeley.EDU>.
	
Wed Aug 19 23:24:50 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* configure, configure.in: Removed the explicit check for the
 	install program, as this is done automatically.  Bug reported by
 	Tony <stuckey@jaka.ece.uiuc.edu>.
	
Wed Aug 19 23:17:11 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

 	data/Freeciv, data/helpdata.txt, server/cityhand.c,
 	server/plrhand.c, server/unitfunc.c, server/unitfunc.h,
 	server/unithand.c: The latest round of spy/diplomat changes from
 	Kris Bubendorfer <Kris.Bubendorfer@MCS.VUW.AC.NZ>.
	
Wed Aug 19 23:09:33 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* client/Freeciv.h, client/repodlgs.c, common/city.c, data/Freeciv:
 	Addition to the city report dialog: (+gold/science/luxury) Patch
 	supplied by Dee Jay Randall <randal@cs.uregina.ca> and David
 	Pfitzner <dwp@mso.anu.edu.au>.
	
Wed Aug 19 22:47:40 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* client/citydlg.c: On some systems (SunOS 4.1.2 is the one in
 	question), sprintf returns a 'char *' instead of an 'int'.  This
 	fixes that.  Patch submitted by Trevor Pering
 	<pering@tongass.EECS.Berkeley.EDU>.
	
Wed Aug 19 22:47:11 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* server/gamehand.c: Added capability code for the scorelog.  Patch
 	submitted by Trevor Pering <pering@tongass.EECS.Berkeley.EDU>.
	
Wed Aug 19 22:45:43 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* common/game.c, common/game.h, common/map.h, server/plrhand.c,
 	server/stdinhand.c: Some changes so that a score file is generated
 	which can be used to generate graphs of different statistics over
 	time. This is very similar to the graphs generated in CivI at the
 	end of the game.
	
	When the "scorelog" server option is turned on, a file called
 	"civscore.log" is created and updated every turn.  A post-
 	processing perl script (which can be found in the Freeciv contrib
 	dir) is then used to parse the log file and generate the output
 	files, which are formatted for "xgraph".
	
	This was submitted by Trevor Pering
 	<pering@tongass.EECS.Berkeley.EDU>.
	
Wed Aug 19 22:43:25 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* data/helpdata.txt: Updated the anarchy help text.  Patch
 	submitted by Peter Schaefer <schaefer@malaga.math.uni-augsburg.de>.
	
Tue Aug 18 23:53:25 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* ai/aihand.c: Fixed a problem where if a human player is being set
 	to ai while in ANARCHY, the ai would not go out of it.  Patch
 	submitted by Peter Schaefer <schaefer@malaga.math.uni-augsburg.de>.
	
Tue Aug 18 23:50:09 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* client/helpdlg.h: Fixed a minor bug in the new, improved Freeciv
 	1.7.0 help system.  In the civclient, when I select Help Playing,
 	the help system doesn't know where to go.  In particular, it
 	doesn't go to "Strategy and Tactics."  It seems that it gets
 	confused because "Playing" != "Strategy and Tactics".  Bug report
 	by Andrew E. Schulman <andrex@alw.nih.gov>, and patch by David
 	Pfitzner <dwp@mso.anu.edu.au>.
	
Tue Aug 18 11:37:53 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* ai/aiunit.c, common/game.c, common/map.c, common/map.h,
 	server/gotohand.c, server/plrhand.c, server/settlers.c: The tile
 	structure had a city ID in it, which is silly because city IDs are
 	pretty much useless.  Changed it to a city pointer which should
 	make map_get_city() a lot faster.  I wonder if this makes the city
 	cache (actually city id index would be a better name, because it
 	doesn't really "cache") unnecessary.
	
Tue Aug 18 11:34:06 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/civserver.c: Initialized the city cache before a saved
 	game is loaded.  Fixed the ID allocation function to ship ID 0.
	
Tue Aug 18 11:30:28 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/cityhand.c: Changed the city cache a little bit.  Tried a
 	few hashing algorithms, but no hashing at all worked best.
	
Sun Aug 16 02:02:01 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.c, server/unittools.h: Renaming rate_unit to
 	rate_unit_d, and adding rate_unit_a for analogous funct
 	get_attacker, which findvictim will call.  Returning 0 in friendly
 	cities in enemies_at. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug 16 02:00:29 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/settlers.c: Adding territory array to try to keep
 	autosettlers safer.  The implementation is not very good, but I had
 	to do something.  Allowing ferryboats for very long
 	intracontinental trips.  Checking ZOC legality before trying to
 	disembark. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug 16 01:58:38 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gotohand.c: Adding could_be_my_zoc to allow paths past
 	distant enemy units.  Discouraging Kaput! in find_a_dir. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug 16 01:55:52 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/city.h: Adding invasion to city ai struct -- Syela
	
Sun Aug 16 01:53:44 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Adding util funct tile_is_accessible so explorers
 	don't keep banging their heads into a ZOC-brick-wall.  Doing tricky
 	things to unit_bellig because get_attack_power is 99% worthless.
  	Writing invasion_funct, whose purpose is to force the AI to send
 	warships where its infantry are, and to send its infantry where its
 	warships are.  In reality, it tends not to make enough ground
 	troops, but it's at least tolerable now.  Writing is_my_turn so
 	that units in a stack attack in order; previously the invader would
 	attack before the battleships sometimes.  Hacking findvic so that
 	units defending cities attack pests more ambitiously.  Hacking
 	d_val so that fast units don't think they need bodyguards.  Keeping
 	invaders on boats longer so they don't disembark and die.
  	Preventing warships from looking for charge, since eight of them
 	would often suddenly try to defend one city.  The real problem is
 	elsewhere, but this kluge is adequate and much easier to program.
  	Treating fieldunits as non-defenders in findjob.  Faking targets in
 	f_s_t_k so that x and y are set even if there's nothing to kill so
 	that the AI will understand that steam engine allows actually
 	useful warships.  Doing lots of weird invasion stuff.  Removing +40
 	city-kill bonus for air/sea units unless ground/heli units are
 	included in the invasion.  Hacking sanity so that very long
 	intracontinental trips allow ferryboats.  Preventing long rides by
 	trireme.  Adding 'g' to attacker-want equation so that the AI sends
 	enough units to flatten a city in one turn.  Kluging so that the AI
 	won't build units just to kill caravans, since that never actually
 	works.  Using funky fprime variable instead of f in the denom, so
 	that def=1 units are penalized correctly.  Adding
 	find_nearest_friendly_port and telling bored ferryboats and wounded
 	warships to go there.  Teaching the AI that frigates are primarily
 	warships.  Not letting units aboard ferries fortify because weird
 	things happen in cities then.  -- Syela
	
Sun Aug 16 01:35:14 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aihand.c: Fixing horrible bug in the forced-disband routine.
  	AI used to disband the only defender of a city in disorder, which
 	is exactly what I intended to prevent.  -- Syela
	
Sun Aug 16 01:33:38 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aicity.c: Adding the line that makes the AI actually (very
 	rarely) build Magellan's.  Adding a wonder-kluge so that cities
 	don't abort almost-built wonders.  Allowing non-military builds if
 	want (usually attacker want) is over 100 with no urgency.  Fixing
 	rounding errors in one of those /30 functions.  Allowing the AI to
 	buy non-defensive units a little earlier than before.  Adding stuff
 	to the list of stuff to save up for.  Making the AI more frugal.
  	Forcing the AI to upgrade its triremes. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug 16 01:29:55 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advmilitary.c: Fixing almost all the typos and other
 	discrepancies between f_s_t_k and k_s_w attacker-want equations,
 	partly as preparation for modularizing that junk.  Adding some util
 	functs, assess_distance, assess_danger_unit.  Treating units that
 	are about to be produced in enemy cities as danger in
 	assess_danger.  Limiting p_d_w to costs <= shield_stock + 40; it
 	was annoying having the AI insist on using battleships for defense.
  	Changing unit_desira so that def=1 units are penalized elsewhere
 	instead.  Changing p_a_w to allow overrides of the chosen attacker
 	in case we need something with more defense or more speed or
 	something.  Doing ugly things to k_s_w that I can't even discern
 	from the diffs.  Fixing more bugs than I can count, or explain - no
 	one else noticed them since they merely caused suboptimal AI
 	behavior.  Want for military techs and handling of unhap is
 	standard and as intended now.  Fixing bug that caused AI warships
 	to yoyo.  Implementing ai.invasion.  Forcing the AI to build
 	defenders instead of attackers when it's in danger.  Forcing the AI
 	to build barracks before ground attackers.  Preventing the AI from
 	building units it can't upkeep.  Treating all unbuilt ground
 	attackers as vet, which encourages making barracks and ground
 	attackers.  I did a lot, and I probably forgot something. -- Syela
	
Fri Aug 14 22:52:10 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/civserver.h, server/sernet.c: Removed lots of extra
 	prototypes from civserver.h for functions that aren't in
 	civserver.c, then added another include to sernet.c because of a
 	missing prototype.
	
Fri Aug 14 22:47:03 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* common/packets.c: Fixed bug were the client would sometimes not
 	realize that an improvement was obsoleted by a wonder.
	
Fri Aug 14 22:45:17 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* common/city.c: Some small performance improvement to
 	wonder_replacement().
	
Fri Aug 14 21:52:45 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/unithand.c: Fixed an old bug so the liberated/conquered
 	messages show up correctly.
	
Thu Aug 13 15:40:43 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aitools.c, ai/aitools.h, server/unitfunc.c, server/unithand.c:
 	Removing unused and broken dist_nearest_enemy_* functs.  Creating
 	and protoing dist_nearest_city, then calling it in the
 	combat-notify's.  Adding minor (almost meaningless) change to let
 	AI cities building wonders keep doing so.  Stopping AI warships on
 	GOTO.  Rewriting the 'Hey idiot' debug code to use abort() and to
 	abort() only if ai.passenger is nonzero, which should prevent
 	human-induced crashes.  Leaving the abort() in until I'm totally
 	sure the AI doesn't cause the problem itself.  Forcing AI units to
 	end moves early instead of moving right next to something that will
 	kill them. -- Syela
	
Thu Aug 13 09:45:20 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/packhand.c: Last patched used a global variable not
 	declared in this file, so it didn't even compile.  Used the helper
 	function get_unit_in_focus() rather than punit_focus directory, and
 	added the include file for update_menus().
	
Thu Aug 13 09:20:18 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/cityturn.c: Another bug pointed out by Walter Misar,
 	PACKET_TILE_INFO should have been TILE_KNOWN.
	
Thu Aug 13 08:57:37 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Fixed bug pointed out by Walter Misar,
 	capturing a city didn't give you any techs.  This has been around
 	since the future tech patch, I can't believe no one noticed until
 	now.
	
Thu Aug 13 07:31:28 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/stdinhand.c: Bug found by Benjamin Korvemaker, the maximum
 	map width was actually the max map height.
	
Wed Aug 12 14:15:40 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* client/menu.c, client/packhand.c: "Build Railroad" never shows up
 	in the Orders menu, even if it is a valid option.  I have rigged
 	this so that "Build Railroad" replaces "Build Road" in the Options
 	menu when appropriate.
	
	As I was working on this fix, I noticed a bug: If you click on a
 	unit which is engaged in some activity (pollution cleanup, road
 	building, etc.)  the Orders menu does not reflect the fact that
 	this unit is idle and can accept new orders until you click on that
 	unit a SECOND time. I found a fix for this problem and incorporated
 	it into this patch as well.  Patch submitted by Cedric Tefft
 	<cedric@earthling.net>.
	
Tue Aug 11 16:59:24 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/Freeciv.h, client/citydlg.c, client/mapctrl.c,
 	client/mapctrl.h, client/repodlgs.c, common/packets.c,
 	common/packets.h, data/Freeciv, server/civserver.c,
 	server/unithand.c, server/unithand.h: Added a option to upgrade
 	individual units to the present units menu in the city dialog.  Had
 	to add a new packet type to the server to support doing this.
	
Sun Aug  9 09:23:47 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/citytools.c: Crashless and more readable (if not
 	standardly whitespaced) version of transfer_city_units. -- Syela
	
Fri Aug  7 23:51:45 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/repodlgs.c: The trade report code was looking pretty
 	crufty, so I fixed it up.
	
Fri Aug  7 04:48:36 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/repodlgs.c: Removed C++ comments from two lines.  Moved a
 	line around too.
	
Thu Aug  6 17:16:52 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/Freeciv.h, client/dialogs.c, data/Freeciv: The diplomat
 	dialog didn't work, it looked like someone forgot to add the
 	resources necessary for the new button.  Fixed it.
	
Thu Aug  6 12:09:55 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* data/helpdata.txt: Added the explore command to the help text.
	
Thu Aug  6 03:27:48 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* configure: Updating version number to 1.7.0.  Good show,
 	Mitch. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 20:14:06 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: Updating NEWS and ChangeLog - Mitch's unenviable
 	burden -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 20:10:47 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* README, configure.in, client/Freeciv.h, client/connectdlg.c,
 	common/shared.h, data/Freeciv, data/helpdata.txt,
 	debian/civclient.man, debian/civserver.man, debian/copyright,
 	server/gamehand.c: Committing Mitch Davis's patch to update the
 	version number to 1.7.0 and add man files and copyright notice in
 	debian/ -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 20:07:25 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/dialogs.c, common/unit.c, common/unit.h,
 	data/helpdata.txt, server/citytools.c, server/cityturn.c,
 	server/gamehand.c, server/unitfunc.c, server/unitfunc.h,
 	server/unithand.c: Committing Kris Bubendorfer's patch to repair
 	spy/diplomat bugs, allow spies to poison cities, and to mung
 	create_unit. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 20:04:39 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/repodlgs.c: Christian Grothoff's patch to display all
 	improvements in trade dialog. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 20:03:48 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gamehand.c: David Pfitzner's patch so early 1.6.4
 	savefiles will load. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 20:03:13 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/unit.c: Jason Merrill's patch so that military units can
 	pillage. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 20:02:19 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* CREDITS, README, freeciv_hackers_guide.txt: Correcting typos and
 	grammatical errors in documentation.  Patch supplied by Markus
 	Linnala. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 20:01:28 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* data/helpdata.txt: Clarifying help on Hanging Gardens (Greg
 	Wooledge again) -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 20:00:08 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/helpdlg.h, client/menu.c, data/helpdata.txt: Adding Greg
 	Wooledge's help on combat. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:58:24 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aihand.c, server/cityturn.c, server/plrhand.c: Implementing
 	Peter Schaefer's patches to prevent taxes, science, and building
 	upkeep during anarchy. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:55:03 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.c: Changing enemies_at to be a little more
 	efficient and less omniscient. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:54:33 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/stdinhand.c: Adding funct set_ai_level, and adding and
 	doc'ing normal and hard commands to invoke it. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:53:00 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/settlers.c: Adding util funct is_wet so that autosettlers
 	won't want to irrigate tiles they have no reason to know are
 	irrigable.  Adding enemies_at check in findwork; this is not nearly
 	adequate to stop settlers from going to their deaths, but is better
 	than nothing. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:51:02 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gotohand.h: Adding orig_x and orig_y to warmap (still
 	unused) -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:50:45 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gotohand.c: Treating from ocean (presumably ferryboat) to
 	land moves as 3 instead of something bizarre in LAND_MOVING warmap.
  	Averaging outgoing and incoming move costs in LAND_MOVING warmap,
 	since pathological cases led to pathological behavior where the AI
 	thought danger was much farther away than it was.  Adding orig_x
 	and orig_y to warmap, but not implementing them anywhere. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:48:15 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityturn.c: Quick hack to stop widespread disorder in AI
 	nations whose Gardens or Oracle become obsolete. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:47:19 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/player.h: Adding more ai handicaps, ones I could actually
 	implement, and protoing ai_handicap funct. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:44:01 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/player.c: Adding funct ai_handicap. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:43:34 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/city.h: Changing grave_danger back to int. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:38:36 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Implementing H_HUTS so that normal-mode AI explorers
 	won't move straight to huts on unseen tiles.  Increasing ct in
 	explorer loop (PART TWO) so that fast units explore further.
  	Teaching exploring boats that exploring coastlines is better than
 	exploring open sea.  This is actually important for the normal-mode
 	AI.  Adding could_unit check so that I don't get annoying ZOC
 	violation messages.  Changing unit_vul so that defenders against
 	virtual (id=0) attackers are treated as fully healed.  Restoring
 	the city-kill bonus in findvictim which I inadvertently hosed at
 	some point in the past.  Implementing H_TARGETS so that AI in
 	normal mode won't target anything it hasn't seen.  Altering
 	ai_manage_ferryboat so that ferryboats may explore rather than
 	going home in normal mode. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:34:08 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aihand.c: Implementing H_RATES, so the AI in normal mode won't
 	set its rates beyond its government_max_rate. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:33:19 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aicity.c: Giving the AI some clue what to do on fallbacks,
 	which seem only to occur with techlevel=0.  Hosing the DOOMED
 	clause, since I hosed grave_danger.  Telling the AI not to spend
 	1000 on battleships for defense anymore; I don't know how well this
 	will work yet, although it seems correct.  Not saving money for
 	B_AQUEDUCT if we only want it because we're celebrating.  Saving
 	money for it hosed the celebration, leading to ridiculous
 	flipflops.  Rewriting worst_elvis_tile, which has been defective
 	for months, but I only noticed last night when I was doing
 	last-minute modifications and Boston decided to have disorder N
 	turns in a row.  Adding resolved/unresolved printf to emergency
 	subroutine. -- Syela
	
Wed Aug  5 19:30:03 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advmilitary.c: Adding dangerfunct so that danger amortization
 	is 2^(1-t) instead of 1/t^2.  Treating units adjacent to city as 3
 	away instead of whatever the warmap thinks.  Changing grave_danger
 	to an int, but not implementing my master plan yet.  It needs to
 	acknowledge that four veteran dragoons outside a city are more than
 	four times as dangerous as one.  Moving the v/=30 to fix a possible
 	problem where the AI berserkly wants FEUDALISM.  Adding a +=
 	urgency in m_a_c_b so that the AI will buy if danger==def.  Adding
 	emergency-wall code which actually worked when I tried it (once),
 	but isn't necessarily verified yet. -- Syela

Wed Aug  5 19:25:53 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* README.AI: Updating AI intro, doc'ing normal and hard modes,
 	updating list of known and recently resolved problems. -- Syela

Tue Aug  4 22:41:17 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.h: Protoing can_unit_attack_unit_at_tile and
 	enemies_at. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:40:57 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.c: Changing can_unit_attack_tile into a wrapper
 	for can_unit_attack_unit_at_tile.  Adding enemies_at, which is
 	mostly-working but not dangerous. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:40:10 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unithand.c: Fixing dist_nearest call in unit_versus, and
 	adding outside %s as a possible notify.  Correcting spelling of
 	successful.  Adding ACTIVITY_EXPLORE as a special case in
 	handle_unit_ac_req. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:38:53 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Fixing bug in get_virtual_defense_power so
 	that ground units on ocean tiles return 0.  Implementing
 	ACTIVITY_EXPLORE in update_unit_ac.  Correcting dist_nearest call
 	in kill_unit and adding 'outside %s' as a possible notification.
  	-- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:36:25 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/settlers.c: Fixing ancient bug in ai_do_build_city where
 	punit is freed and then referenced.  Initing ww to 99999 in
 	findwork so that v2=0 activities are not attempted.  Doing ZOC
 	check before settlers try to disembark.  Fixing syntax error in a
 	memset that doesn't matter. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:34:22 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gotohand.h: Protoing could_unit_move_to_tile so aiunit
 	can call it. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:34:02 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gotohand.c: Adding arbitrary deterrent for GOTO'ing
 	through unseen tiles.  Tinkering with the passenger in find_the,
 	which probably has no meaning whatsoever.  Adding transport
 	paranoia code, which mostly works thanks to the new util funct
 	enemies_at.  This isn't perfect and if I figure out why I might
 	fix it later today.  Fixing the 'passenger cannot disembark' thing
 	which I messed up so badly the first time I couldn't believe it
 	when I saw it.  Adding passenger to find_a_dir for more transport
 	paranoia.  In find_a_dir, avoiding the unknown if we are on our
 	last move.  Allowing -1 to be returned if moving would be into the
 	jaws of death.  Adding same_pos check in goto_is_sane.  Aborting
 	goto's with no moves_left much sooner than before to save CPU
 	cycles. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:28:47 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* data/tiles.xpm: Adding X tile for ACTIVITY_EXPLORE. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:27:07 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* data/Freeciv: Adding <Key>x for key_unit_explore. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:26:16 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/unit.c: Changing MAGELLAN to give 2 moves, not 1.  Adding

 	are in explore mode. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:23:30 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/mapctrl.c, client/mapctrl.h: Adding and protoing
 	key_unit_explore. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:22:59 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/Freeciv.h: Adding <Key>x to put units in explore mode. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:21:56 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.h: Protoing a bunch of functs that now may be called
 	from other modules: ai_manage_explorer, unit_belligerence, _basic,
 	unit_vulnerability, _virtual, _quadratic, unit_can_defend. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:17:02 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Correcting unit_move_turns now that MAGELLAN
 	actually gives 2 moves.  Deleting obsolete quick'n'dirty
 	unit_defensiveness and replacing it with the much smarter new
 	funct assess_defense_unit.  Hacking ai_manage_explorer so that it
 	can handle non-AI units, including boats.  Changing the arbitrary
 	value in the really slow part so that explorers don't get stuck so
 	easily, and also calling unit_move_turns instead of assuming our
 	explorer was an IGTER ground unit.  Writing quick'n'dirty
 	stack_attack_value because the old bodyguard code didn't
 	acknowledge stacks of muskets as a threat to howitzers.  Rewriting
 	reinforcements_cost and _value to save enormous amounts of CPU
 	time since the last versions were so badly implemented.  Also
 	changing them to continue if aunit==punit, so taking account of
 	that in findvictim.  Upgrading the need-bodyguard calc using
 	stack_attack.  Fixing bugs in gothere that I can't really explain
 	but that which were causing AI invaders to either stall or get
 	stuck for no good reason.  Oops; I still have debug printfs in
 	here; will remove them later today.  Using quadratic defense in
 	look_for_charge and findjob for bodyguards.  Using
 	assess_defense_unit instead of the really bad joke in the
 	is-it-safe-to-leave calculation.  Acknowledging units already
 	present in the horrible init in f_s_t_k.  And I'm not done yet! -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:09:03 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aitools.c: Fixing ancient mistake in dist_nearest_enemy_city
 	that allowed unseen cities to be returned.  Also hacking it so it
 	gives the nearest city on any continent if (x,y) is in the
 	ocean. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:08:05 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aihand.c: Forcing the AI to save up for citywalls/defenders
 	it needs even if it's a good time to love the president. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:07:32 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aicity.c: Teaching the AI when to build MAGELLAN.  Also
 	telling it SDI is worth saving money for if it's about to be
 	nuked. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:06:28 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advmilitary.h: Protoing new functs assess_defense_unit and
 	_quadratic. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:06:07 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advmilitary.c: Fixed some bugs giving an implicit *1.5 to
 	boats defending cities.  Wrote assess_defense_quadratic to stop
 	the AI from building piles of small units or from reallocating
 	piles of small units to one city.  Wrote assess_defense_unit.
  	Rewrote assess_defense_backend to handle the new functs.  Fixed a
 	syntax error that caused a memset to misbehave. -- Syela
	
Mon Aug  3 02:27:42 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Fixing bug where giving AI an empire with missiles
 	crashes the game.  Fixing bug where AI warships can choose
 	landlocked targets. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 23:28:37 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* configure, configure.in, client/Freeciv.h, common/shared.h,
 	data/Freeciv: Bumped all the version numbers to 1.6.6.
	
Sun Aug  2 20:30:59 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.c: Adding unit name to zone of control notify.
  	One of my AI functs is misbehaving re: ZOC, and this is useful to
 	debug it as well as in general. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:30:00 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unithand.c: Adding a bunch of ferryboat and bodyguard
 	stuff to handle_unit_move_request. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:29:14 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Preventing nukes from reducing size 1 cities
 	to size 0.  I don't know how The Other Game does this, so this
 	might need checked. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:27:43 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/stdinhand.c: Adding undoc'd crash command. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:26:52 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/settlers.h: Protoing other_passengers, changing proto for
 	find_boat. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:26:24 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/settlers.c: Replacing hardcoded 8 with TRADE_WEIGHTING.
  	I probably have more of these lurking somewhere.  More strongly
 	encouraging coastal cities to be near lots of water instead of
 	only a little.  Adding rather arbitrary deterrent to using
 	settlers to help cities grow.  No longer zeroing ferryboat in
 	auto_settler_do_goto; it's in unithand now.  Changing find_boat so
 	that punit is no longer an arg (we just trust the map), but
 	minimum capacity is.  Adding util funct other_passengers, which
 	I'm probably going to end up obsoleting now that multiple
 	passengers are handled intelligently.  Adding ai_choice to
 	findwork so that AIs will want Navigation if colony sites exist
 	outside trireme range.  Choosing the best tile to improve if
 	multiple tiles offer equal opportunity instead of choosing the
 	NWmost.  Refusing to allow settlers to help cities grow if they
 	can do anything else useful.  Otherwise the AI was settling its
 	settlers, creating workers for unimproved tiles, and then needing
 	settlers to improve them.  Not allowing a settler riding a
 	warferryboat to divert it.  Forcing settlers to disembark early
 	with other_passengers, but this is probaly no longer necessary. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:18:13 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gotohand.c: Adding time_saving abort in generate_warmap
 	to prevent useless duplication; some of the AI functs would
 	otherwise generate redundant warmaps.  Fixing bug involving dir_ok
 	halfway around the world from the destination.  Acknowledging
 	passenger ZOC in ferryboat goto paths.  Treating rails as free
 	even for IGTER units finally.  Encouraging units to choose
 	roads/rails in find_a_dir for flexibility later. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:14:51 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/civserver.c: Forcing the AI to manage its units BEFORE
 	end_turn, not during. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:14:00 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityturn.c: Handling e/luxneed/pwr in worker_loop better
 	to stop AI emergencies. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:13:17 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/unit.c: Changing is_transporter_with_free space to return
 	free space. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:12:37 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/city.h: Adding urgency and who's-killing-us temp vars a
 	and f to city_ai. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:11:27 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.h: Protoing new functs look_for_charge and
 	find_beachhead. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:07:10 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Reordering functs so that low-level routines come
 	first and high-level routines come later in the file.  Adding util
 	funct unit_move_turns which actually acknowledges MAGELLAN, but I
 	need to implement it a dozen more places.  Adding bodyguard/charge
 	stuff.  Making bodyguards zero their charge if they should change
 	homecity.  Adding unit_vul_virtual.  Changing the desperation
 	kluge so that units don't attack with certain death, although
 	probable death is still OK.  Hacking findvictim to return an int.
  	Hacking findvictim so ferryboats do not attack.  Adding more
 	safeguards to prevent SIGFPE's when non-attackers try to attack.
  	Adding ai_military_bodyguard.  Adding find_beachhead for
 	invasions.  Adding bodyguard code to ai_military_gothere.  Adding
 	invasion code to ai_military_gothere.  Adding util funct
 	unit_can_defend for findjob and new funct look_for_charge.
  	Allowing a lot of defenders to become bodyguards if needed as
 	such.  Calling generate_warmap more than I would like; it seems to
 	slow the game down some.  Adding invasion code to
 	find_something_to_kill.  Using unit_being_aggressive to calc
 	unhap.  Making ai_manage_ferryboat a lot more intelligent
 	regarding multiple passengers and not leaving shore too soon.
  	Maybe something else, but with the rearranging of functs, the
 	diffs are ugly. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 19:57:40 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aihand.c: Moving ai_manage_units out of ai_do_last so that
 	units can have their final move before enemy cities get to build
 	stuff.  Fixing stupidity in ai_manage_taxes where it was possible
 	to feed a negative index to an array - was causing aberrant
 	behavior, mostly selling buildings during pointless celebrations.
  	Getting rid of some unused code.  Being a little more careful not
 	to sell stuff because of rounding errors.  There is a minor quirk
 	in this routine that I still need to fix, but I wanted to upload
 	it in a mostly-working state. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 19:54:19 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aicity.h: Protoing ai_choose_defender_by_type and changing
 	proto for ai_choose_defender_limited to match. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 19:53:47 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aicity.c: AI not buying wonders with have 50 or more
 	build_points_left.  Changing the syntax to
 	ai_choose_defender_limited so that move_type can be an arg.
  	Adding ai_choose_defender_by_type.  Disbanding unhappy units that
 	cause unrest in emergency_r_w. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 19:50:44 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advmilitary.c: Regarding only ground units and ferryboats as
 	grave or urgent danger.  Fixing huge, important, obvious bug where
 	the AI didn't comprehend that units on other continents were
 	dangerous.  Caching urgency so that defenders in urgency-0 cities
 	can become bodyguards.  Changing the big ugly want equation in
 	p_a_w and k_s_w to handle co-ordinated attacks and invasions via
 	ferryboat.  Adding code to m_a_c_b so that the AI might (it very
 	rarely does, it seems) build defenders purely to become
 	bodyguards.  I think that's everything. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 19:39:17 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advdomestic.c: Giving the AI appropriate disregard for the
 	WALL. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 15:34:46 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/Freeciv.h, client/helpdlg.c, data/Freeciv: Vision range
 	displayed in the unit help, from David Pfitzner.
	
Wed Jul 29 21:39:19 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Unlinking returning spy from tile->units
 	before sending her home, then inserting her in her new
 	tile->units.  Also stalling AI military ground units on GOTO,
 	which is meaningless now but will be useful when I upload the
 	current aiunit.c. -- Syela
	
Wed Jul 29 16:22:42 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/dialogs.c, client/dialogs.h, client/packhand.c,
 	common/packets.c, common/packets.h, server/unitfunc.c,
 	server/unithand.c: Used the same system I did for revolt inciting
 	to remove the bribe cost from the unit info packet.  Only had to
 	modify 7 files this time.
	
Wed Jul 29 16:11:09 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* common/unit.h, server/plrhand.c: Removed unit_bribe_cost() from
 	the unit.h header, because it isn't in unit.c any more.  Added the
 	unittools.h header to plrhand.c.
	
Wed Jul 29 13:30:03 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/civclient.c, client/dialogs.c, client/dialogs.h,
 	client/packhand.c, client/packhand.h, common/packets.c,
 	common/packets.h, server/cityhand.c, server/civserver.c,
 	server/unithand.c, server/unithand.h: Took the incite_revolt_cost
 	out of the city_info packet.  Sounds simple, eh?  I needed to
 	modify 11 files to do it.  Since inciting happens only rarely,
 	it's wasteful to send the data with every city update.  Now when a
 	diplomat tries to incite, a INCITE_INQ packet is sent asking how
 	much it will cost.  Then the client receives an INCITE_COST packet
 	from the server, and pops up the yes/no dialog.  If players with
 	lagged connections try to incite more than one city very quickly
 	(before the server INCITE_COST comes back), weird things might
 	happen.  I doubt this will actually happen in a game.  This change
 	also allows incite cost to be updated dynamically.  Before the
 	cost was computed at the beginning of the turn and didn't change.
  	Now if you do something to change the cost, like kill all the
 	units in the city and reduce its size, the cost will go down.
	
Wed Jul 29 01:18:07 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unithand.c: Removing destroyed cities from the minimap.

 	minimap. -- Syela
	
Wed Jul 29 01:13:22 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityhand.c: Removing brokenly-implemented
 	remove_city_from_minimap from remove_city; it was corrupting the
 	minimap.  Forcing reset_move_costs in remove_city and create_city.
  	My stupid failure to do so earlier led to the AI's reluctance to
 	build boats. -- Syela
	
Tue Jul 28 23:04:53 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/unit.c: Adding is_ground_unit check in
 	get_transporter_capacity (David Pfitzner) Adding case for
 	unimplemented ACTIVITY_EXPLORE in unit_activity_text, and added
 	the unknown punit->activity in the LOG_FATAL.  -- Syela
	
Tue Jul 28 23:01:54 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aicity.c: Fixing ai_find_elvis_pos so that it doesn't panic
 	about anticipated famine when dealing with e large.  Horrible
 	mistake on my part. -- Syela
	
Tue Jul 28 22:59:13 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityturn.c, server/cityturn.h: Protoing

Tue Jul 28 22:58:33 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gamehand.c: Including capability.h; stops implicit

Tue Jul 28 12:40:49 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/citydlg.c, client/packhand.c, common/city.c,
 	common/city.h, common/packets.c, common/packets.h,
 	server/cityhand.c, server/cityturn.c, server/plrhand.c: Changed
 	the way trade route value was calculated.  The value of a trade
 	route no longer takes the trade produced by other trade routes
 	into account.  Before it would sometimes depending on which order
 	the routes were computed in.  The value of the trade route is sent
 	with the CITY_INFO packet to the client.  The client uses this
 	information rather than trying to compute the value isself, since
 	it doesn't know enough to get it right.  The format for the
 	CITY_INFO packet has been shrunk by 6-14 bytes.
	
Tue Jul 28 12:37:41 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, client/Makefile.am,
 	client/Makefile.in, server/Makefile.am, server/Makefile.in: Fixing
 	the broken makefiles that didn't export many files (including
 	server/gotohand.h and client/*.ico).  This is what broke beta
 	1.6.4.
	
Tue Jul 28 12:15:12 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* server/unithand.c: Cities weren't being refreshed when a trade
 	route was formed.  The update for the destination city might not
 	get sent to the right player.  Fixed.
	
Tue Jul 28 09:49:52 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

 	doing so fixed a bug with emergency_reallocate.  Made the

 	the THRESHOLD, but too low for closer targets.  Fixing a dorky
 	typo that only survived because memsetting the virtualunit didn't
 	set its id to 0.  Zeroing it manually.  Treating FIELDUNITs in a

	Implementing city cache and ai_calc cache in the city_ai struct.
  	This gives a fivefold CPU savings in the benchmark at 800-600 BC,
 	and should be even more necessary later in games.  Deleting old
 	find_city_by_id, but leaving it proto'd in city.h.  Adding new
 	cache-based find_city_by_id to cityhand, and forcing the client to
 	use game_find_city_by_id instead since it's the same as the old
 	one.
	
	In order to make sure I hadn't broken anything, I compiled with
 	-Wall -Werror, and in order to do so, I had to proto a bunch of
 	functs and eliminate unused variables in most of the files I'm
 	committing.  My own sloppiness is to blame for most of that.

 	server/citytools.h, server/stdinhand.c, server/unitfunc.c,
 	server/unitfunc.h, server/unithand.c: This change set concerns
 	spies and diplomats, making them operate more in line with Civ II.
  	That is, spies may survive a mission, and units in a bought city
 	are transferred to the new owner etc.  Multiple bugs in the code
 	in this area were also fixed.
	
	1.  Numerous bug fixes of sabotage/steal code, where messages
	    were being sent incorrectly.
	
	2.  Cities were not being razed correctly in diplomat_incite.
	    Now they aren't razed, as per Civ II.
	
	3.  get_a_tech is now called in incite as well as in
	    unit_enter_city.  After all, buying a city should give you
	    the same opportunity to `discover' new technology as
	    invading the city does.
	
	4.  All units (military and non military) are now transferred to
	    the player who purchased the city.  Units outside of the
	    city are either deleted, or if in another city, are assigned
	    that city as their homecity.
	
	    This also cures the current bug, where a unit in a bought
	    city that has a different homecity, remains in the bought
	    city - even though it is now owned by the purchaser.  Thus
	    the enemy can simply move out and back in - recapturing the
	    newly bought city.
	
	5.  A diplomat now has a chance (ala Civ II) of defeating
	    defending diplomat/spy units in a city.  This chance is set
	    via the set diplchance command from the server console.  It
	    defaults to a 1/3 chance of the attacking diplomat/spy
	    killing each defending diplomat/spy.
	
	6.  Spies (not diplomats) may now survive their mission (ala Civ
	    II).  The chance that a spy will be returned to it's home
	    city is also 1/diplchance.  This increases the value of
	    spies over diplomats.

Thu Jul  9 15:58:31 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* server/civserver.c: If you try to select your race and choose
 	the player name that you initially connected to the server with,

 	Tefft <cedric@earthling.net>.
	
Mon Jul  6 17:24:20 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* Makefile.in, ai/Makefile.in, client/Makefile.in,
 	common/Makefile.in, data/Makefile.in, server/Makefile.in:
 	Makefile.in files are normally generated from Makefile.am, but we
 	provide them for people who don't have automake.  In this case,
 	the Makefile.in files we were shipping did not support the
 	generation and checking of dependency information.  Reran automake
 	to regenerate them.  Done on the good advice of Falk Hueffner
 	<falk.hueffner@student.uni-tuebingen.de>.
	
Mon Jul  6 17:18:11 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

 	<sverkerw@Update.UU.SE>.
	
Mon Jul  6 06:42:31 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/game.c, common/game.h, common/map.h, server/civserver.c,
 	server/civserver.h, server/stdinhand.c: Cedric Tefft's patch to
 	create 'aifill' variable.  It originally sometimes crashed my
 	client when I was connected as an AI before game-start, but he
 	sent me a fix that seems to have worked. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 23:57:25 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* data/helpdata.txt: There are two lines which exceed the
 	68-character limit, and at least one grammatical mistake.  This
 	patch fixes all three problems.  Patch provided by Greg Wooledge
 	<gawooledge@sherwin.com>
	
Sun Jul  5 23:50:24 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* client/citydlg.c, client/dialogs.c, client/repodlgs.c,

Sun Jul  5 07:36:57 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.h: Removed proto's of removed functs, added
 	proto's of added functs. -- Syela

Sun Jul  5 07:36:22 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.c: Temporarily disabling
 	new_is_already_assigned and reverting to old.  The RIDICULOUS bug
 	regarding a unit on goto entering a tile where another settler
 	works was easily fixed in the old funct, and not easily fixed in
 	the new one.  This wasn't a problem until I made settlers on goto
 	stop and think every turn.
	
	Obliterated old random-looking ai_calc_* routines and wrote new
 	ones that follow the pattern set out in ai_eval_bu.  These
 	currently call city_tile_value which gives the right answers but
 	wastes a lot of CPU time.  I wanted to make sure it was right;
 	later I'll get around to making it efficient as well.
	
	Wrote road_bonus so that the AI blazes trails and doesn't just build
	randomly.  Rewrote in_city_radius to save CPU time.  -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:31:11 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unithand.c: Changing in_city_radius call since it's been
 	rewritten. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:30:02 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.h: Changing auto_settler_findwork proto since it
 	now returns an int. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:29:37 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Fixed the bug where settlers aboard
 	disappearing triremes crash the game.  Annihilated old autosettler
 	code.  Rewrote auto_settler_findwork and spent many hours testing
 	it, taking notes, and making changes.  It seems to be OK, so I'm
 	uploading it, but I wouldn't call it stable.  Weightings may need
 	to be changed.  The CPU usage is definitely unacceptable and I
 	will optimize this further but I need to upload it now.  Forcing
 	gotoing settlers to idle so they can re-evaluate their plans. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:24:59 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/mapgen.c: Removed island_info from yet another module.
  	-- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:24:23 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityturn.c: Wrote global_city_refresh, but didn't add any
 	calls to it yet. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:23:32 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/citytools.h: Proto'd worst_worker_tile_value. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:23:16 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/citytools.c: Made city_tile_value a little smarter about
 	foodneed and prodneed.  Added worst_worker_tile_value for
 	autosettler code. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:21:47 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityhand.h: Defined FOOD_, SHIELD_, and
 	TRADE_WEIGHTING. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:21:06 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityhand.c: Deleted ai_calculate_city_value comment, and
 	added a fnord in case I decide to use this model to save time.  I
 	really hate it and it cripples the AI badly but the CPU savings
 	may require it. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:19:45 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/player.h: Removed ai_player_island.  Made comments about
 	removing race structs. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:18:41 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/map.c: Map_adjusted x and y in map_set and
 	map_clear_special. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:18:03 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.h: Defined MORT, and then kluged (in aiunit.c) so that
 	MORT is sort-of hardcoded.  This may be fixed once I figure out
 	how to get city_des exactly right with the least CPU effort.
  	Proto'd new functs. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:15:38 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Removed lots of obsolete functions.  Wrote new
 	functions to replace them (relating to settlers).  Tidied up
 	findjob a little.  Forced caravans to idle every turn instead of
 	blindly gotoing cities that are no longer producing wonders.
  	Wrote amortize, which is very necessary for city_des, and is still
 	too slow but not as horrible as it was yesterday.  Generated
 	minimaps to include virtual city locations.  This is a
 	quick-n-dirty and may not last the week.  Spent days and days
 	working on city_des, which seems to be right with the current
 	value for the WAG at the bottom.  Forced settlers who are building
 	cities to remain in BUILD_CITY and others to be in AUTO_SETTLER
 	because the minimap checks it. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:10:06 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aitools.h: Removed references to obliterated old, obsolete
 	AI. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:09:22 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aitools.c: Removed all references to island_info!  Removed

Sun Jul  5 07:06:06 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advmilitary.c: Changed maxcost to THRESHOLD * 6 + 2 to
 	facilitate new settler AI code.  Fixed a bug with illegal moves in
 	warmap when (punit). -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:03:45 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advdomestic.c: Adding more .h includes.  Fixing the quirk
 	where lux rate reduced building_wants.  Included taxmen in food
 	surplus estimates.  Removed *_weighting arrays to use *_WEIGHTING
 	defines.  Added quick-n-dirty fix to moderate lust for
 	marketplaces when tax rate jumps.  New, smarter want equations for
 	aqueducts and sewer system.  Corrected want for MFG.
	
	Obliterated old settler code, including expand_*.  Finding work
 	for a virtualunit to establish want for settlers.  This went
 	through a lot of trial and error and it seems to be working
 	acceptably now.
	
	Added SPY as yet another fallback until real diplomacy code is in.

- Fixed hardcoded tile size in select units pop-up
- Reorganized tile layout in the XPM files.  Client can handle different sized
  tile sets.

- Crosshair placed on goto destination when unit is inspected with the
  middle mouse button.  Change to protocol to send goto destination.
- Fixed bug in the selection of the hitpoint bar

  would disappear from other people's maps.
- Added -s option to server, lets you explicity set hostname metaserver reports
- Fix typo in metaserver code, PRE_GAME_STATE instead of CLIENT_PRE_GAME_STATE

   PACKET_PLAYER_TECH_GOAL, pinfo->tech_goal)
  Added food supply to city dialog and recentered dialog header
  Added 'Export log' option to the Game menu (log_output_window)

  Split up ai_manage_city, ai_do_activities, can_build_improvement,
   handle_city_buy, set_trade_prod, add_buildings_effect
  Wrote real_map_distance, sq_map_distance, could_build_improvement,
   shuffle_players, could_unit_move_to_tile, really_handle_city_buy
  
-- Some behind the scenes elements of the AI
  
  Wrote advdomestic.c, advmilitary.c, ai_manage_buildings,
   ai_city_choose_build, ai_choose_attacker,  unit_attack_desirability,
   ai_choose_defender_limited, many utilities in aitech.c, ai_select_tech,

   unit_defensiveness, find_something_to_kill, probably more in ai/*.c,
   city_tile_value, better_tile, wants_to_be_bigger, probably more.
  Obsoleted old ai_city_choose_build, ai_spend_gold, best_tile, best_food_tile
  Rewrote worst_elvis_tile, ai_find_elvis_pos, ai_make_elvis,
    make_scientists_taxmen, ai_manage_taxes, ai_manage_government,
    auto_settler_findwork
  
  Updated somewhat the comments in aihand.c to show what I'd done
  Started ai_manage_city with a city_check_workers
  Hacked ai_next_tech_goal to use my (not-yet-ready) ai_select_tech_goal
  Correctly calculated agression in findtarget so pikemen don't attack
   and legions on mountains do
  Returned maxbuycost in ai_gold_reserve if the AI really needs money

  Forced military units idle at top and bottom of ai_manage_military
  Forced military units to fortify if possible at bottom of ai_manage_military
  Reset the ai_roles for military units every turn to prevent tunnel-vision
  Added AIUNIT_EXPLORE for units to explore
  Added building_want, danger, trade_want, grave_danger to city AI
  Added maxbuycost, tech_want, tech_turns to player ai
  Fixed ai_military_findjob so that the right unit defends cities and others don't
   and to allow military units to explore (find huts, map-discover, etc.)
  Fixed ai_military_attack to use my AI
  Made the AI not place workers that would be unhappy
  Aborted goto for AI units instead of attacking without using AI attack functs
  Forced asess_danger for ai players and civ_score on game load

- altered the autoplace worker algorithm yet again, now i think it
  works decently (well atleast it suits my playstile)
- veteran status wasn't updated on the client side.
- upgrade units in active units dialog. allows you to upgrade your old out of
  date units, that is in a city square to a new and more modern version.
  will cost you some gold tho.. the side effect of this is leonardo's workshop
  which i'm still not sure if i want to incorporate or not.
- u for unload ship
- 'all' button on the wake up units
- Found one of the ancient gigantic bugs, and a fix for it 
  as it was, units didn't get a homecity on the server before the game was
  saved and reloaded, now this will help alot for the game balance. 
- Peter Skov fixed the problem with saving before game has started in a neat
  way by saving the settings instead of a game, this means you can make your
  favorite settings then save them to a file which you can use later on.
  with the -f server switch. 
- can't change all the map dependent options after the game has started.. 
- fixed a little problem with the help button on the science dialog.
- removed a bug that had sneaked into the support of units calculations.
- compiled it with some strict options and found a few minor bugs..
- added a civ1-2 switch but it doesn't do anything yet. need a voluenteer
  to do the civ1 tech tree and unit-building dependencies.
- The unit values  and the techtree has been checked and has been adjusted 
  according to civ 2.42 rules.

1.3.0
- Peter Skov added the following client features & server fixes
    * help in the city dialog on the units/buildings you can build.
    * a help toggle in the science dialog, if you turn it on, you won't change
      techs, rather it will show the help for this tech.
    * buy and change buttons in the city report, eases the pain of managing 
      your cities. 
    * there had sneaked a bug into top-5 cities, which has also been fixed

- port facility added, if naval unit is build in city with port facility
  unit will be veteran, repairment of a ship in a city with port facility
  only takes 1 turn
- Airport added on server, need to do a client command to activate them
  airborne units will be fully repaired in a city with a airport in 1 turn
  and will initially be veteran if build in a city with airport 
- new techs added radio, machine tools, amphibious warfare
- Shuffles players randomly at new turn, so the first player that connected
  doesn't get the wonder when 2 people are building the same wonder in the
  same round. 

1.2.0
- Extra fast unit info when middle clicking on an unit on the map 
  (attack, defense, firepower)
- Fortresses wasn't saved correctly in the save file.
- Cities are now properly refreshed at end of turn.
- can't buy units when cities are in disorder anymore.
- buildings unnecessary due to wonders like the granaries to pyramids, don't
  show on the build list anymore, if you have an unnecessary building already
  it will be marked with (*)
- autobuild  needed serious fixing, is better now. Still not ideal 
- Made a new mapgenerator, that works on minimum 80x50 maps
  which will make 7 equal sized islands. Still alot of fiddling to do with
  it but it should make things alot more fair.
  So set generator 2 to try the new map generator.
  And keep the number of players below 8....
- changed the "auto choose place to put worker algorithm" a bit now it
  favors huge amounts of trade and production over food.

1.1.6 (never released)
- SDI now give double defense against missile attacks, thats a 
  multiplier by 4 together with SAM batteries..
- SAM batteries added. Double defense against aircrafts
- supermarkets added. 50% food bonus on irrigated tiles
- Hoover dam can now be build, an and should have been an or :)
- Fixed problem with king richards crusade.
- Fixed problem with cruise missiles.
- Fixed problem with martial law under communism and monarchy 
- Fixed problem with wonders not seemingly working first turn after reload
- think i fixed the change tech stuff, now it's not reset on the client
  if you change tech in the round you get one.. Maybe..

1.1.5 (never released (except for 2 persons))
- the city growth can now be adjusted with the foodbox server option
  used instead of the standard 10 multiplier of citysize to determine when
  a city will grow
- number of buildings that will be razed if you conquer or loose a city is
  now a game variable, namely razechance. Palaces will always be destroyed..
- oops fortresses beneath cities gave 100% defense bonus. don't anymore
  units in cities and fortresses always count as fortified.
  coastal fortresses is needed to protect cities, a citywall just won't do
  it anymore. same count for bombers, but there is no defense against them.
  since SAM site haven't been made yet. 
- Hanging gardens converts content to happy if possible, other wonders
  converts unhappy to content.
- Caught in city, a ship used to have 1 in defense, now it has its usual 
  defense, but only 1 in firepower instead.
- Changed the messages when a unit(s) dies. (tells which city if on a city 
  square and what units died always)
- Found some crash bugs while debugging, goto could kill server if unit died 
  while gotoing. (my settler did a goto into a hut with barbarians)
- Changed obsolete tech test, to unit testing in the unit list.
  makes things easier, and more readable.
- remaining units, techs, buildings has been added, but looped..
  just to make sure future savefiles will be consistent, if we want to have 
  them in the game.
1.1.4 (beta tested by 4-5 persons)
- new flags:
  igwall    ignore citywalls, counts for artillery, 
  generates extra unhappy under  republic and democracy (as it has always been)
- happy/content/unhappy fixed according to civ2 rules, be careful out there,
  it's harder now to keep cities happy. 
  (took me a bloody sunday to figure how the exact formula works) 
- cruiser missiles was to cheap, costs 60 now instead of 40, 
  and their firepower is now 3, reduced its hp to 10.
- armor had firepower 2, fixed.
- carriers only 9 defense now, 2 firepower 40 hp's instead.

- got rid of year 0. A nasty hack was needed , but we were getting too many
  reports about it.

- percent penalty instead of 0 when changing tech default 100 
- foodbox server option default 10
- fixed a few bugs in mapgen.c (landmass and swamp is now used)

  o settlers costs 2 food under communism now.
  o cities did loose size by naval or air bombardements, doesn't anymore.

o cities did loose size by naval or air bombardements, doesn't anymore.
  o can only build fortresses after invention of construction
  o can't fortify naval or airborne units anymore.
  o happiness calculations was buggy, among other things colloseums gives
    +4 instead of +3 after development of electricty.
    the luxury and wonder happy calculations has been modified a bit..
  o cities only give a 50% bonus on defense, city walls still give a 200% bonus
    and since they don't cost much in maintainance. Go Build them.
  o movement changes:
    - unit move rates, scaled by lost hp's. allthough land based units have 
      atleast 1 move, naval units 2, and air units isn't affected
    - moves and fuel wasn't in the savefiles, they are now.
    - discover nuclear power and get + 1 move for naval units.

  o getting a city in a goody hut didn't add a road beneath the city.

o ver 1.0k - August 10
  o server freeze bug fixed thanks to Stefan Andersson.
  o various other bugs fixed too.

o ver 1.0j - Apr 8 
  o Pillage could be done by settlers only. This isn't correct, actually should
    be doable by all land based units, except settlers, caravans & diplomats..
  o Now units with 0 attack/defence power will ALWAYS loose in battle.
  o Reported By Andrew Donkin and patches aswell :).
    - Could make unlimited # of trade routes... Fixed 
    - Units gained hp by building fortresses not when fortified .... Fixed  
  o Problem with nukes, could nuke the server :). 
    Fixed (well not first time i said that) 
    (Reported By Christian Bricart).
  o Problems with list of available tech after getting techs one way or 
    another is hopefully fixed. (noone has been cheated, tech was correct, 
    but the researchable list was not updated.)
  o Tried to fix rolling thunder tactics. new server option cityfactor which
    modify the unhappysize this way: 
    newunhappysize = unhappysize - #cities/(cityfactor - (5-goverment))
    eg. under monarchy with 25 cities, unhappysize 5, cityfactor 14  
    you'll have a newunhappysize of 5 - 25/(14-(5-2)) = 3 ...
    that is lots of cities and low goverment forms, will give unhappiness. 
  o Diplomat treaties are unbalancing the game. Now you have a new variable 
    that can reduce the effect of tech-trading, techcost. Whenever you get a 
    free tech  it'll cost you techcost percent of a normal research cost, 
    to incorporate  it in your society. Standard this variable is 25%. 
    Setting it to 0 will  give you the standard behaviour. So don't look 
    startled if you suddenly have a negative number of tech bulbs.   
  o Tax-Trade-Luxury calculation tended to favor Tax when distributing. Fixed..
  o Goodie huts changed a bit: 
    - different units in huts depending on tech level.
    - no barbarians if hut is in city radius.
    - advanced tribes added.
  o Seperate Popup windows added (see the Game menu (Mes Options)), more to
    be added later.
  o Message Window added, with goto location button.  
  o fixed minor textual details
    (eg.when someone you have contact with gains tech)
  o autosettlers added, use this option at your own risk..
    Press A to activate them.
  o New server option cavalry, allows players to start with a number of 
    cavalry.
  o Game will not start before Minplayers has connected. 
  o buffed lighthouse, now owner will not loose triremes at sea. 
  o Diplomats will now be able to defend cities, against other diplomats.
  o Rivers only costs 1/3 movepoint to travel on.
  o Altered the startposition algorithm, should even out things abit.
    A side effect of this lets small maps eg 40x25 work, server used to loop..
    (well atleast for a reasonable amount of players)
o ver 1.0h - feb 16
  Massimo Campostrini once again supplied us with historical correct
  citynames - this time for the Aztecs.
  Proper error message when the xpm files can't be opened.
  Panner widget allow resizing of chat window.
  A huge pile of bugs, reported to us by Goswin Brederlow, has been
  fixed.
  Pedantic detail: Default setting of game-save interval was 1. 
  Correct value is 10.
  Notification added when player with whom you have an embassy invents 
  something. 
  Game will end if only one player is alive.
  Announcement of building wonders now include which city that builds it.
  Notifies attacker if his attack was succesful or not
  resets light bulbs at end of turn if player gets a tech. 
  Check every turn if units on ocean has transporters enough.
  If wonder was autobuild it wouldn't be announced. (fixed)
  Bug in mapgen.c fixed, start positions could be real close.
  Added a steal flag to the city structure, can only be stolen once from
  every city now, restarts if the city has been conquered. Don't know if this
  is correct..
  Trade Routes are now modified according to the continental rules.
  (both cities on same continents halfes the output).
  Hoover dam and Michelangelo's Chapel only affects the continent
  on which they have been built.
  Gaining a free tech in huts worked before but gave a wrong message, 
  this has been fixed aswell.
  Fixed bug located by Robert Wilton, in unit_activity_text()
  Fixed zone of control bug, now you can always enter and leave a city.
  saved alot of cycles in goto, no affect on game play. 

o ver 1.0f - jan 26
  The X resource leak fixed. Citynames initial go. Now handling the
  wm_delete_window event.
  Ouch that genlist fix in 1.0e made another bug visible in the
  transporter code. Stephan Boettcher patched that and fixed bug

o ver 1.0e - jan 26
  Applied patches submited by Massimo Campostrini, concerning citynames
  and diplomat action messages.
  Fixed nasty leak in the pixcomm widget. Fixed leak in genlist's

  The main info widget is now clickable, to produce a small
  popup, containing some more info.

o ver 1.0c - jan 12
  Fixed bug in citydialog introduced in 1.0b. Made the code handling the
  overview map much more efficient. Let X parse command line options.
