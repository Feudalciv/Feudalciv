1.6.1 (mjd)
- Moved the CHANGES file to ChangeLog, to comply with the GNU standard.
- Updated many version numbers to 1.6.
- Added the CREDITS file to the list of files to go into the .tar.gz.
- Updated the web page to http://freeciv.ultraviolet.org
- Made the civ and ser scripts smarter: They now look in two dirs for
  the exes to run.
- Removed a whole lot of autogenerated files which should not have been
  checked into 1.6.0.  This is what caused compilation and library
  problems for MANY people who tried 1.6.0.

1.6.0 
- *A LOT* of changes from Olav Andree Brevik. Thank you VERY much!
- Helicoptors loose 10% of hp per turn when outside city (Olav)

- Non-ground units in cities regain hp too. (Olav)
- Flying units report moves left (Olav)
- Total moves in change production menu (Olav)
- Railroads now built into city tiles, even when taking a city from an
  inferior race. (Olav)
- Future Technologies added. Add 5 points to score (Olav) 
- Autoconf added thanks to Falk Hueffner. Now we can configure just like
  the big boys!

- Client option to display tiles sets with transparent flags better
- Granary counter in the city dialog wasn't the right size when foodbox!=10
- Fixes to city dialog so different sized tiles will work
- The connect dialog will pop-up when the connection is lost before the
  game starts
- Pop-up windows weren't getting freed in the client, resulting is large
  resource leak
- Memory leak fixed in select units pop-up, pixmaps weren't getting freed

- altered the autoplace worker algorithm yet again, now i think it
  works decently (well atleast it suits my playstile)
- veteran status wasn't updated on the client side.
- upgrade units in active units dialog. allows you to upgrade your old out of
  date units, that is in a city square to a new and more modern version.
  will cost you some gold tho.. the side effect of this is leonardo's workshop
  which i'm still not sure if i want to incorporate or not.
- u for unload ship
- 'all' button on the wake up units
- Found one of the ancient gigantic bugs, and a fix for it 
  as it was, units didn't get a homecity on the server before the game was
  saved and reloaded, now this will help alot for the game balance. 
- Peter Skov fixed the problem with saving before game has started in a neat
  way by saving the settings instead of a game, this means you can make your
  favorite settings then save them to a file which you can use later on.
  with the -f server switch. 
- can't change all the map dependent options after the game has started.. 
- fixed a little problem with the help button on the science dialog.
- removed a bug that had sneaked into the support of units calculations.
- compiled it with some strict options and found a few minor bugs..
- added a civ1-2 switch but it doesn't do anything yet. need a voluenteer
  to do the civ1 tech tree and unit-building dependencies.
- The unit values  and the techtree has been checked and has been adjusted 
  according to civ 2.42 rules.

1.3.0
- Peter Skov added the following client features & server fixes
    * help in the city dialog on the units/buildings you can build.
    * a help toggle in the science dialog, if you turn it on, you won't change
      techs, rather it will show the help for this tech.
    * buy and change buttons in the city report, eases the pain of managing 
      your cities. 
    * there had sneaked a bug into top-5 cities, which has also been fixed

- port facility added, if naval unit is build in city with port facility
  unit will be veteran, repairment of a ship in a city with port facility
  only takes 1 turn
- Airport added on server, need to do a client command to activate them
  airborne units will be fully repaired in a city with a airport in 1 turn
  and will initially be veteran if build in a city with airport 
- new techs added radio, machine tools, amphibious warfare
- Shuffles players randomly at new turn, so the first player that connected
  doesn't get the wonder when 2 people are building the same wonder in the
  same round. 

1.2.0
- Extra fast unit info when middle clicking on an unit on the map 
  (attack, defense, firepower)
- Fortresses wasn't saved correctly in the save file.
- Cities are now properly refreshed at end of turn.
- can't buy units when cities are in disorder anymore.
- buildings unnecessary due to wonders like the granaries to pyramids, don't
  show on the build list anymore, if you have an unnecessary building already
  it will be marked with (*)
- autobuild  needed serious fixing, is better now. Still not ideal 
- Made a new mapgenerator, that works on minimum 80x50 maps
  which will make 7 equal sized islands. Still alot of fiddling to do with
  it but it should make things alot more fair.
  So set generator 2 to try the new map generator.
  And keep the number of players below 8....
- changed the "auto choose place to put worker algorithm" a bit now it
  favors huge amounts of trade and production over food.

1.1.6 (never released)
- SDI now give double defense against missile attacks, thats a 
  multiplier by 4 together with SAM batteries..
- SAM batteries added. Double defense against aircrafts
- supermarkets added. 50% food bonus on irrigated tiles
- Hoover dam can now be build, an and should have been an or :)
- Fixed problem with king richards crusade.
- Fixed problem with cruise missiles.
- Fixed problem with martial law under communism and monarchy 
- Fixed problem with wonders not seemingly working first turn after reload
- think i fixed the change tech stuff, now it's not reset on the client
  if you change tech in the round you get one.. Maybe..

1.1.5 (never released (except for 2 persons))
- the city growth can now be adjusted with the foodbox server option
  used instead of the standard 10 multiplier of citysize to determine when
  a city will grow
- number of buildings that will be razed if you conquer or loose a city is
  now a game variable, namely razechance. Palaces will always be destroyed..
- oops fortresses beneath cities gave 100% defense bonus. don't anymore
  units in cities and fortresses always count as fortified.
  coastal fortresses is needed to protect cities, a citywall just won't do
  it anymore. same count for bombers, but there is no defense against them.
  since SAM site haven't been made yet. 
- Hanging gardens converts content to happy if possible, other wonders
  converts unhappy to content.
- Caught in city, a ship used to have 1 in defense, now it has its usual 
  defense, but only 1 in firepower instead.
- Changed the messages when a unit(s) dies. (tells which city if on a city 
  square and what units died always)
- Found some crash bugs while debugging, goto could kill server if unit died 
  while gotoing. (my settler did a goto into a hut with barbarians)
- Changed obsolete tech test, to unit testing in the unit list.
  makes things easier, and more readable.
- remaining units, techs, buildings has been added, but looped..
  just to make sure future savefiles will be consistent, if we want to have 
  them in the game.
1.1.4 (beta tested by 4-5 persons)
- new flags:
  igwall    ignore citywalls, counts for artillery, 
  generates extra unhappy under  republic and democracy (as it has always been)
- happy/content/unhappy fixed according to civ2 rules, be careful out there,
  it's harder now to keep cities happy. 
  (took me a bloody sunday to figure how the exact formula works) 
- cruiser missiles was to cheap, costs 60 now instead of 40, 
  and their firepower is now 3, reduced its hp to 10.
- armor had firepower 2, fixed.
- carriers only 9 defense now, 2 firepower 40 hp's instead.

- got rid of year 0. A nasty hack was needed , but we were getting too many
  reports about it.

- percent penalty instead of 0 when changing tech default 100 
- foodbox server option default 10
- fixed a few bugs in mapgen.c (landmass and swamp is now used)

  o settlers costs 2 food under communism now.
  o cities did loose size by naval or air bombardements, doesn't anymore.

o cities did loose size by naval or air bombardements, doesn't anymore.
  o can only build fortresses after invention of construction
  o can't fortify naval or airborne units anymore.
  o happiness calculations was buggy, among other things colloseums gives
    +4 instead of +3 after development of electricty.
    the luxury and wonder happy calculations has been modified a bit..
  o cities only give a 50% bonus on defense, city walls still give a 200% bonus
    and since they don't cost much in maintainance. Go Build them.
  o movement changes:
    - unit move rates, scaled by lost hp's. allthough land based units have 
      atleast 1 move, naval units 2, and air units isn't affected
    - moves and fuel wasn't in the savefiles, they are now.
    - discover nuclear power and get + 1 move for naval units.

  o getting a city in a goody hut didn't add a road beneath the city.

o ver 1.0k - August 10
  o server freeze bug fixed thanks to Stefan Andersson.
  o various other bugs fixed too.

o ver 1.0j - Apr 8 
  o Pillage could be done by settlers only. This isn't correct, actually should
    be doable by all land based units, except settlers, caravans & diplomats..
  o Now units with 0 attack/defence power will ALWAYS loose in battle.
  o Reported By Andrew Donkin and patches aswell :).
    - Could make unlimited # of trade routes... Fixed 
    - Units gained hp by building fortresses not when fortified .... Fixed  
  o Problem with nukes, could nuke the server :). 
    Fixed (well not first time i said that) 
    (Reported By Christian Bricart).
  o Problems with list of available tech after getting techs one way or 
    another is hopefully fixed. (noone has been cheated, tech was correct, 
    but the researchable list was not updated.)
  o Tried to fix rolling thunder tactics. new server option cityfactor which
    modify the unhappysize this way: 
    newunhappysize = unhappysize - #cities/(cityfactor - (5-goverment))
    eg. under monarchy with 25 cities, unhappysize 5, cityfactor 14  
    you'll have a newunhappysize of 5 - 25/(14-(5-2)) = 3 ...
    that is lots of cities and low goverment forms, will give unhappiness. 
  o Diplomat treaties are unbalancing the game. Now you have a new variable 
    that can reduce the effect of tech-trading, techcost. Whenever you get a 
    free tech  it'll cost you techcost percent of a normal research cost, 
    to incorporate  it in your society. Standard this variable is 25%. 
    Setting it to 0 will  give you the standard behaviour. So don't look 
    startled if you suddenly have a negative number of tech bulbs.   
  o Tax-Trade-Luxury calculation tended to favor Tax when distributing. Fixed..
  o Goodie huts changed a bit: 
    - different units in huts depending on tech level.
    - no barbarians if hut is in city radius.
    - advanced tribes added.
  o Seperate Popup windows added (see the Game menu (Mes Options)), more to
    be added later.
  o Message Window added, with goto location button.  
  o fixed minor textual details
    (eg.when someone you have contact with gains tech)
  o autosettlers added, use this option at your own risk..
    Press A to activate them.
  o New server option cavalry, allows players to start with a number of 
    cavalry.
  o Game will not start before Minplayers has connected. 
  o buffed lighthouse, now owner will not loose triremes at sea. 
  o Diplomats will now be able to defend cities, against other diplomats.
  o Rivers only costs 1/3 movepoint to travel on.
  o Altered the startposition algorithm, should even out things abit.
    A side effect of this lets small maps eg 40x25 work, server used to loop..
    (well atleast for a reasonable amount of players)
o ver 1.0h - feb 16
  Massimo Campostrini once again supplied us with historical correct
  citynames - this time for the Aztecs.
  Proper error message when the xpm files can't be opened.
  Panner widget allow resizing of chat window.
  A huge pile of bugs, reported to us by Goswin Brederlow, has been
  fixed.
  Pedantic detail: Default setting of game-save interval was 1. 
  Correct value is 10.
  Notification added when player with whom you have an embassy invents 
  something. 
  Game will end if only one player is alive.
  Announcement of building wonders now include which city that builds it.
  Notifies attacker if his attack was succesful or not
  resets light bulbs at end of turn if player gets a tech. 
  Check every turn if units on ocean has transporters enough.
  If wonder was autobuild it wouldn't be announced. (fixed)
  Bug in mapgen.c fixed, start positions could be real close.
  Added a steal flag to the city structure, can only be stolen once from
  every city now, restarts if the city has been conquered. Don't know if this
  is correct..
  Trade Routes are now modified according to the continental rules.
  (both cities on same continents halfes the output).
  Hoover dam and Michelangelo's Chapel only affects the continent
  on which they have been built.
  Gaining a free tech in huts worked before but gave a wrong message, 
  this has been fixed aswell.
  Fixed bug located by Robert Wilton, in unit_activity_text()
  Fixed zone of control bug, now you can always enter and leave a city.
  saved alot of cycles in goto, no affect on game play. 

o ver 1.0f - jan 26
  The X resource leak fixed. Citynames initial go. Now handling the
  wm_delete_window event.
  Ouch that genlist fix in 1.0e made another bug visible in the
  transporter code. Stephan Boettcher patched that and fixed bug

  The main info widget is now clickable, to produce a small
  popup, containing some more info.

o ver 1.0c - jan 12
