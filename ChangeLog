Wed Aug  5 18:04:54 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* README, configure.in, client/Freeciv.h, client/connectdlg.c,
 	common/shared.h, data/Freeciv, data/helpdata.txt,
 	debian/civclient.man, debian/civserver.man, debian/copyright,

 	  from going away.  
	- Changed all references from freeciv.ultraviolet.org to
 	  www.freeciv.org.
	
Wed Aug  5 18:03:59 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* data/helpdata.txt: The old help text said "Makes one unhappy or
 	content citizen happy. Makes 2 extra happy faces in the city
 	containing the Hanging Gardens."
	
	According to the code, you get 1 "bonus" in every city, and 2 more
 	"bonuses" for a total of 3 in the city that contains the Gardens.
  	Patch submitted by Greg Wooledge <wooledge@kellnet.com>.
	
Wed Aug  5 18:02:05 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* ai/aihand.c: Removed the lines that cause the ai to go to
 	anarchy.  Patch submitted by Peter Schaefer
 	<schaefer@malaga.math.uni-augsburg.de>.
	
Wed Aug  5 18:01:43 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* server/cityturn.c: makes anarchy a bad choice as all trade will
 	be converted to luxury. However, there is no maintenance to pay
 	for buildings( which is in accordance to civ1 rules. civII ? ).
  	Obsolete wonders will still give money, and specialists will
 	continue doing their job.  There is also no mention of trade
 	routes in the function changed.  The official tax rate will not
 	reflect the 100% luxury rate, which saves you the trouble to
 	readjust it back.  Patch submitted by Peter Schaefer
 	<schaefer@malaga.math.uni-augsburg.de>.
	
Wed Aug  5 18:01:08 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* server/plrhand.c: Repair the problems caused by the ai going to
 	anarchy by checking whether we are in a legal anarchy state; There
 	was one function which escaped previous fixes.  Patch submitted by
 	Peter Schaefer <schaefer@malaga.math.uni-augsburg.de>.
	
Wed Aug  5 18:00:45 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* server/gamehand.c: A fix so that Freeciv reads 1.6.4 save files
 	that don't include the capability string.  Patch supplied by David
 	Pfitzner <dwp@mso.anu.edu.au>.
	
Wed Aug  5 18:00:18 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

 	data/helpdata.txt, server/citytools.c, server/cityturn.c,
 	server/gamehand.c, server/unitfunc.c, server/unitfunc.h,
 	server/unithand.c:
	
	1.  Fixed a problem with units not being deleted properly that
 	    have different home cities to the incited city.  This removes
 	    the phantom units.

	2.  Bribed units have the moves_left fixed.
	3.  Sabotage now kills the unsuccessful Spy/Diplomat
	4.  Steal tech now generates proper dialog
	5.  Spies can now poison cities
	6.  Updated Diplomat/Spy help.
	Patch supplied by Kris Bubendorfer <Kris.Bubendorfer@MCS.VUW.AC.NZ>.
	
Wed Aug  5 17:59:33 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* common/unit.c: Changed the code so that military units are also
 	allowed to pillage.  Patch supplied by Jason Merrill
 	<jason@yorick.cygnus.com>.
	
Wed Aug  5 17:58:51 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* client/helpdlg.h, client/menu.c, data/helpdata.txt: Updated the

 	running Freeciv through Ispell.  Patch supplied by Markus Linnala
 	<maage@cs.tut.fi>.
	
Wed Aug  5 17:54:51 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* client/repodlgs.c: This patch modifies the trade-report to make
 	it show all buildings and not just the ones with no cost.  Patch
 	submitted by Christian Grothoff <ma0035@stud.uni-wuppertal.de>.
	
Tue Aug  4 22:41:17 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.h: Protoing can_unit_attack_unit_at_tile and
 	enemies_at. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:40:57 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.c: Changing can_unit_attack_tile into a wrapper
 	for can_unit_attack_unit_at_tile.  Adding enemies_at, which is
 	mostly-working but not dangerous. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:40:10 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unithand.c: Fixing dist_nearest call in unit_versus, and
 	adding outside %s as a possible notify.  Correcting spelling of
 	successful.  Adding ACTIVITY_EXPLORE as a special case in
 	handle_unit_ac_req. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:38:53 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Fixing bug in get_virtual_defense_power so
 	that ground units on ocean tiles return 0.  Implementing
 	ACTIVITY_EXPLORE in update_unit_ac.  Correcting dist_nearest call
 	in kill_unit and adding 'outside %s' as a possible notification.
  	-- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:36:25 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/settlers.c: Fixing ancient bug in ai_do_build_city where
 	punit is freed and then referenced.  Initing ww to 99999 in
 	findwork so that v2=0 activities are not attempted.  Doing ZOC
 	check before settlers try to disembark.  Fixing syntax error in a
 	memset that doesn't matter. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:34:22 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gotohand.h: Protoing could_unit_move_to_tile so aiunit
 	can call it. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:34:02 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gotohand.c: Adding arbitrary deterrent for GOTO'ing
 	through unseen tiles.  Tinkering with the passenger in find_the,
 	which probably has no meaning whatsoever.  Adding transport
 	paranoia code, which mostly works thanks to the new util funct
 	enemies_at.  This isn't perfect and if I figure out why I might
 	fix it later today.  Fixing the 'passenger cannot disembark' thing
 	which I messed up so badly the first time I couldn't believe it
 	when I saw it.  Adding passenger to find_a_dir for more transport
 	paranoia.  In find_a_dir, avoiding the unknown if we are on our
 	last move.  Allowing -1 to be returned if moving would be into the
 	jaws of death.  Adding same_pos check in goto_is_sane.  Aborting
 	goto's with no moves_left much sooner than before to save CPU
 	cycles. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:28:47 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* data/tiles.xpm: Adding X tile for ACTIVITY_EXPLORE. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:27:07 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* data/Freeciv: Adding <Key>x for key_unit_explore. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:26:16 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/unit.c: Changing MAGELLAN to give 2 moves, not 1.  Adding
 	ACTIVITY_EXPLORE to can_unit_do_activity. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:25:37 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/xmain.c: Adding key_unit_explore. -- Syela

	* client/mapview.c: Defining X_TILE and displaying it when units
 	are in explore mode. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:23:30 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/mapctrl.c, client/mapctrl.h: Adding and protoing
 	key_unit_explore. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:22:59 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* client/Freeciv.h: Adding <Key>x to put units in explore mode. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:21:56 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.h: Protoing a bunch of functs that now may be called
 	from other modules: ai_manage_explorer, unit_belligerence, _basic,
 	unit_vulnerability, _virtual, _quadratic, unit_can_defend. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:17:02 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Correcting unit_move_turns now that MAGELLAN
 	actually gives 2 moves.  Deleting obsolete quick'n'dirty
 	unit_defensiveness and replacing it with the much smarter new
 	funct assess_defense_unit.  Hacking ai_manage_explorer so that it
 	can handle non-AI units, including boats.  Changing the arbitrary
 	value in the really slow part so that explorers don't get stuck so
 	easily, and also calling unit_move_turns instead of assuming our
 	explorer was an IGTER ground unit.  Writing quick'n'dirty
 	stack_attack_value because the old bodyguard code didn't
 	acknowledge stacks of muskets as a threat to howitzers.  Rewriting
 	reinforcements_cost and _value to save enormous amounts of CPU
 	time since the last versions were so badly implemented.  Also
 	changing them to continue if aunit==punit, so taking account of
 	that in findvictim.  Upgrading the need-bodyguard calc using
 	stack_attack.  Fixing bugs in gothere that I can't really explain
 	but that which were causing AI invaders to either stall or get
 	stuck for no good reason.  Oops; I still have debug printfs in
 	here; will remove them later today.  Using quadratic defense in
 	look_for_charge and findjob for bodyguards.  Using
 	assess_defense_unit instead of the really bad joke in the
 	is-it-safe-to-leave calculation.  Acknowledging units already
 	present in the horrible init in f_s_t_k.  And I'm not done yet! -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:09:03 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aitools.c: Fixing ancient mistake in dist_nearest_enemy_city
 	that allowed unseen cities to be returned.  Also hacking it so it
 	gives the nearest city on any continent if (x,y) is in the
 	ocean. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:08:05 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aihand.c: Forcing the AI to save up for citywalls/defenders
 	it needs even if it's a good time to love the president. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:07:32 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aicity.c: Teaching the AI when to build MAGELLAN.  Also
 	telling it SDI is worth saving money for if it's about to be
 	nuked. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:06:28 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advmilitary.h: Protoing new functs assess_defense_unit and
 	_quadratic. -- Syela
	
Tue Aug  4 22:06:07 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advmilitary.c: Fixed some bugs giving an implicit *1.5 to
 	boats defending cities.  Wrote assess_defense_quadratic to stop
 	the AI from building piles of small units or from reallocating
 	piles of small units to one city.  Wrote assess_defense_unit.
  	Rewrote assess_defense_backend to handle the new functs.  Fixed a
 	syntax error that caused a memset to misbehave. -- Syela
	
Mon Aug  3 02:27:42 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Fixing bug where giving AI an empire with missiles
 	crashes the game.  Fixing bug where AI warships can choose
 	landlocked targets. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 23:28:37 1998  Mitch Davis <mjd@alphalink.com.au>

	* configure, configure.in, client/Freeciv.h, common/shared.h,
 	data/Freeciv: Bumped all the version numbers to 1.6.6.
	
Sun Aug  2 20:30:59 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.c: Adding unit name to zone of control notify.
  	One of my AI functs is misbehaving re: ZOC, and this is useful to
 	debug it as well as in general. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:30:00 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unithand.c: Adding a bunch of ferryboat and bodyguard
 	stuff to handle_unit_move_request. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:29:14 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Preventing nukes from reducing size 1 cities
 	to size 0.  I don't know how The Other Game does this, so this
 	might need checked. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:27:43 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/stdinhand.c: Adding undoc'd crash command. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:26:52 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/settlers.h: Protoing other_passengers, changing proto for
 	find_boat. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:26:24 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/settlers.c: Replacing hardcoded 8 with TRADE_WEIGHTING.
  	I probably have more of these lurking somewhere.  More strongly
 	encouraging coastal cities to be near lots of water instead of
 	only a little.  Adding rather arbitrary deterrent to using
 	settlers to help cities grow.  No longer zeroing ferryboat in
 	auto_settler_do_goto; it's in unithand now.  Changing find_boat so
 	that punit is no longer an arg (we just trust the map), but
 	minimum capacity is.  Adding util funct other_passengers, which
 	I'm probably going to end up obsoleting now that multiple
 	passengers are handled intelligently.  Adding ai_choice to
 	findwork so that AIs will want Navigation if colony sites exist
 	outside trireme range.  Choosing the best tile to improve if
 	multiple tiles offer equal opportunity instead of choosing the
 	NWmost.  Refusing to allow settlers to help cities grow if they
 	can do anything else useful.  Otherwise the AI was settling its
 	settlers, creating workers for unimproved tiles, and then needing
 	settlers to improve them.  Not allowing a settler riding a
 	warferryboat to divert it.  Forcing settlers to disembark early
 	with other_passengers, but this is probaly no longer necessary. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:18:13 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/gotohand.c: Adding time_saving abort in generate_warmap
 	to prevent useless duplication; some of the AI functs would
 	otherwise generate redundant warmaps.  Fixing bug involving dir_ok
 	halfway around the world from the destination.  Acknowledging
 	passenger ZOC in ferryboat goto paths.  Treating rails as free
 	even for IGTER units finally.  Encouraging units to choose
 	roads/rails in find_a_dir for flexibility later. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:14:51 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/civserver.c: Forcing the AI to manage its units BEFORE
 	end_turn, not during. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:14:00 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityturn.c: Handling e/luxneed/pwr in worker_loop better
 	to stop AI emergencies. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:13:17 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/unit.c: Changing is_transporter_with_free space to return
 	free space. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:12:37 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/city.h: Adding urgency and who's-killing-us temp vars a
 	and f to city_ai. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:11:27 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.h: Protoing new functs look_for_charge and
 	find_beachhead. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 20:07:10 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Reordering functs so that low-level routines come
 	first and high-level routines come later in the file.  Adding util
 	funct unit_move_turns which actually acknowledges MAGELLAN, but I
 	need to implement it a dozen more places.  Adding bodyguard/charge
 	stuff.  Making bodyguards zero their charge if they should change
 	homecity.  Adding unit_vul_virtual.  Changing the desperation
 	kluge so that units don't attack with certain death, although
 	probable death is still OK.  Hacking findvictim to return an int.
  	Hacking findvictim so ferryboats do not attack.  Adding more
 	safeguards to prevent SIGFPE's when non-attackers try to attack.
  	Adding ai_military_bodyguard.  Adding find_beachhead for
 	invasions.  Adding bodyguard code to ai_military_gothere.  Adding
 	invasion code to ai_military_gothere.  Adding util funct
 	unit_can_defend for findjob and new funct look_for_charge.
  	Allowing a lot of defenders to become bodyguards if needed as
 	such.  Calling generate_warmap more than I would like; it seems to
 	slow the game down some.  Adding invasion code to
 	find_something_to_kill.  Using unit_being_aggressive to calc
 	unhap.  Making ai_manage_ferryboat a lot more intelligent
 	regarding multiple passengers and not leaving shore too soon.
  	Maybe something else, but with the rearranging of functs, the
 	diffs are ugly. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 19:57:40 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aihand.c: Moving ai_manage_units out of ai_do_last so that
 	units can have their final move before enemy cities get to build
 	stuff.  Fixing stupidity in ai_manage_taxes where it was possible
 	to feed a negative index to an array - was causing aberrant
 	behavior, mostly selling buildings during pointless celebrations.
  	Getting rid of some unused code.  Being a little more careful not
 	to sell stuff because of rounding errors.  There is a minor quirk
 	in this routine that I still need to fix, but I wanted to upload
 	it in a mostly-working state. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 19:54:19 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aicity.h: Protoing ai_choose_defender_by_type and changing
 	proto for ai_choose_defender_limited to match. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 19:53:47 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aicity.c: AI not buying wonders with have 50 or more
 	build_points_left.  Changing the syntax to
 	ai_choose_defender_limited so that move_type can be an arg.
  	Adding ai_choose_defender_by_type.  Disbanding unhappy units that
 	cause unrest in emergency_r_w. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 19:50:44 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advmilitary.c: Regarding only ground units and ferryboats as
 	grave or urgent danger.  Fixing huge, important, obvious bug where
 	the AI didn't comprehend that units on other continents were
 	dangerous.  Caching urgency so that defenders in urgency-0 cities
 	can become bodyguards.  Changing the big ugly want equation in
 	p_a_w and k_s_w to handle co-ordinated attacks and invasions via
 	ferryboat.  Adding code to m_a_c_b so that the AI might (it very
 	rarely does, it seems) build defenders purely to become
 	bodyguards.  I think that's everything. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 19:39:17 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advdomestic.c: Giving the AI appropriate disregard for the
 	WALL. -- Syela
	
Sun Aug  2 15:34:46 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/Freeciv.h, client/helpdlg.c, data/Freeciv: Vision range
 	displayed in the unit help, from David Pfitzner.
	
Wed Jul 29 21:39:19 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Unlinking returning spy from tile->units
 	before sending her home, then inserting her in her new
 	tile->units.  Also stalling AI military ground units on GOTO,
 	which is meaningless now but will be useful when I upload the
 	current aiunit.c. -- Syela
	
Wed Jul 29 16:22:42 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/dialogs.c, client/dialogs.h, client/packhand.c,
 	common/packets.c, common/packets.h, server/unitfunc.c,
 	server/unithand.c: Used the same system I did for revolt inciting
 	to remove the bribe cost from the unit info packet.  Only had to
 	modify 7 files this time.
	
Wed Jul 29 16:11:09 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* common/unit.h, server/plrhand.c: Removed unit_bribe_cost() from
 	the unit.h header, because it isn't in unit.c any more.  Added the
 	unittools.h header to plrhand.c.
	
Wed Jul 29 13:30:03 1998  Trent Piepho <xyzzy@u.washington.edu>

	* client/civclient.c, client/dialogs.c, client/dialogs.h,
 	client/packhand.c, client/packhand.h, common/packets.c,
 	common/packets.h, server/cityhand.c, server/civserver.c,
 	server/unithand.c, server/unithand.h: Took the incite_revolt_cost
 	out of the city_info packet.  Sounds simple, eh?  I needed to
 	modify 11 files to do it.  Since inciting happens only rarely,
 	it's wasteful to send the data with every city update.  Now when a
 	diplomat tries to incite, a INCITE_INQ packet is sent asking how
 	much it will cost.  Then the client receives an INCITE_COST packet
 	from the server, and pops up the yes/no dialog.  If players with
 	lagged connections try to incite more than one city very quickly
 	(before the server INCITE_COST comes back), weird things might
 	happen.  I doubt this will actually happen in a game.  This change
 	also allows incite cost to be updated dynamically.  Before the
 	cost was computed at the beginning of the turn and didn't change.
  	Now if you do something to change the cost, like kill all the
 	units in the city and reduce its size, the cost will go down.
	
Wed Jul 29 01:18:07 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unithand.c: Removing destroyed cities from the minimap.
 	-- Syela
	
Wed Jul 29 01:14:25 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityturn.c: Removing cities that starve from the
 	minimap. -- Syela
	
Wed Jul 29 01:13:22 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityhand.c: Removing brokenly-implemented
 	remove_city_from_minimap from remove_city; it was corrupting the
 	minimap.  Forcing reset_move_costs in remove_city and create_city.
  	My stupid failure to do so earlier led to the AI's reluctance to
 	build boats. -- Syela

 	their GOTOs when their passengers disembark.  Rewrote the
 	unit_belli and unit_vul stuff, reinf_value,
 	find_something_to_kill, and findvictim in order to make attacker
 	wants somewhat reasonable instead of craven. -- Syela

 	grave or urgent danger.  Not allowing FIELDUNIT as first defender
 	in a city.  Changing unit attack desires; old ones were right at
 	the THRESHOLD, but too low for closer targets.  Fixing a dorky

	Implementing city cache and ai_calc cache in the city_ai struct.
  	This gives a fivefold CPU savings in the benchmark at 800-600 BC,
 	and should be even more necessary later in games.  Deleting old
 	find_city_by_id, but leaving it proto'd in city.h.  Adding new
 	cache-based find_city_by_id to cityhand, and forcing the client to
 	use game_find_city_by_id instead since it's the same as the old
 	one.
	
	In order to make sure I hadn't broken anything, I compiled with
 	-Wall -Werror, and in order to do so, I had to proto a bunch of
 	functs and eliminate unused variables in most of the files I'm
 	committing.  My own sloppiness is to blame for most of that.
	
	Fixing typo in city_affected_by_wonder (broke B_WOMENS).
	Fixing ZOC bug in is_sailing_unit_tile.
	
	Updating version number to 1.6.4.

 	server/citytools.h, server/stdinhand.c, server/unitfunc.c,
 	server/unitfunc.h, server/unithand.c: This change set concerns
 	spies and diplomats, making them operate more in line with Civ II.
  	That is, spies may survive a mission, and units in a bought city
 	are transferred to the new owner etc.  Multiple bugs in the code
 	in this area were also fixed.
	
	1.  Numerous bug fixes of sabotage/steal code, where messages
	    were being sent incorrectly.
	
	2.  Cities were not being razed correctly in diplomat_incite.
	    Now they aren't razed, as per Civ II.
	
	3.  get_a_tech is now called in incite as well as in
	    unit_enter_city.  After all, buying a city should give you
	    the same opportunity to `discover' new technology as
	    invading the city does.
	
	4.  All units (military and non military) are now transferred to
	    the player who purchased the city.  Units outside of the
	    city are either deleted, or if in another city, are assigned
	    that city as their homecity.
	
	    This also cures the current bug, where a unit in a bought
	    city that has a different homecity, remains in the bought
	    city - even though it is now owned by the purchaser.  Thus
	    the enemy can simply move out and back in - recapturing the
	    newly bought city.
	
	5.  A diplomat now has a chance (ala Civ II) of defeating
	    defending diplomat/spy units in a city.  This chance is set
	    via the set diplchance command from the server console.  It
	    defaults to a 1/3 chance of the attacking diplomat/spy
	    killing each defending diplomat/spy.
	
	6.  Spies (not diplomats) may now survive their mission (ala Civ
	    II).  The chance that a spy will be returned to it's home
	    city is also 1/diplchance.  This increases the value of
	    spies over diplomats.

Sun Jul  5 07:36:22 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unittools.c: Temporarily disabling
 	new_is_already_assigned and reverting to old.  The RIDICULOUS bug
 	regarding a unit on goto entering a tile where another settler
 	works was easily fixed in the old funct, and not easily fixed in
 	the new one.  This wasn't a problem until I made settlers on goto
 	stop and think every turn.
	
	Obliterated old random-looking ai_calc_* routines and wrote new
 	ones that follow the pattern set out in ai_eval_bu.  These
 	currently call city_tile_value which gives the right answers but
 	wastes a lot of CPU time.  I wanted to make sure it was right;
 	later I'll get around to making it efficient as well.
	
	Wrote road_bonus so that the AI blazes trails and doesn't just build
	randomly.  Rewrote in_city_radius to save CPU time.  -- Syela

Sun Jul  5 07:30:02 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.h: Changing auto_settler_findwork proto since it
 	now returns an int. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:29:37 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/unitfunc.c: Fixed the bug where settlers aboard
 	disappearing triremes crash the game.  Annihilated old autosettler
 	code.  Rewrote auto_settler_findwork and spent many hours testing
 	it, taking notes, and making changes.  It seems to be OK, so I'm
 	uploading it, but I wouldn't call it stable.  Weightings may need
 	to be changed.  The CPU usage is definitely unacceptable and I
 	will optimize this further but I need to upload it now.  Forcing
 	gotoing settlers to idle so they can re-evaluate their plans. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:24:59 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/mapgen.c: Removed island_info from yet another module.
  	-- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:24:23 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityturn.c: Wrote global_city_refresh, but didn't add any
 	calls to it yet. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:23:32 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/citytools.h: Proto'd worst_worker_tile_value. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:23:16 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/citytools.c: Made city_tile_value a little smarter about
 	foodneed and prodneed.  Added worst_worker_tile_value for
 	autosettler code. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:21:47 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityhand.h: Defined FOOD_, SHIELD_, and
 	TRADE_WEIGHTING. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:21:06 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* server/cityhand.c: Deleted ai_calculate_city_value comment, and
 	added a fnord in case I decide to use this model to save time.  I
 	really hate it and it cripples the AI badly but the CPU savings
 	may require it. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:19:45 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* common/player.h: Removed ai_player_island.  Made comments about

Sun Jul  5 07:18:03 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.h: Defined MORT, and then kluged (in aiunit.c) so that
 	MORT is sort-of hardcoded.  This may be fixed once I figure out
 	how to get city_des exactly right with the least CPU effort.
  	Proto'd new functs. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:15:38 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aiunit.c: Removed lots of obsolete functions.  Wrote new
 	functions to replace them (relating to settlers).  Tidied up
 	findjob a little.  Forced caravans to idle every turn instead of
 	blindly gotoing cities that are no longer producing wonders.
  	Wrote amortize, which is very necessary for city_des, and is still
 	too slow but not as horrible as it was yesterday.  Generated
 	minimaps to include virtual city locations.  This is a
 	quick-n-dirty and may not last the week.  Spent days and days
 	working on city_des, which seems to be right with the current
 	value for the WAG at the bottom.  Forced settlers who are building
 	cities to remain in BUILD_CITY and others to be in AUTO_SETTLER
 	because the minimap checks it. -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:10:06 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/aitools.h: Removed references to obliterated old, obsolete

	* ai/advmilitary.c: Changed maxcost to THRESHOLD * 6 + 2 to
 	facilitate new settler AI code.  Fixed a bug with illegal moves in
 	warmap when (punit). -- Syela
	
Sun Jul  5 07:03:45 1998  John Stonebraker <ppaqebb@surfshop.net>

	* ai/advdomestic.c: Adding more .h includes.  Fixing the quirk
 	where lux rate reduced building_wants.  Included taxmen in food
 	surplus estimates.  Removed *_weighting arrays to use *_WEIGHTING
 	defines.  Added quick-n-dirty fix to moderate lust for
 	marketplaces when tax rate jumps.  New, smarter want equations for
 	aqueducts and sewer system.  Corrected want for MFG.
	
	Obliterated old settler code, including expand_*.  Finding work
 	for a virtualunit to establish want for settlers.  This went
 	through a lot of trial and error and it seems to be working
 	acceptably now.
	
	Added SPY as yet another fallback until real diplomacy code is in.

  	establish_city_distances for caravans. -- Syela

- Made the civ and ser scripts smarter: They now look in two dirs for
  the exes to run.
- Removed a whole lot of autogenerated files which should not have been
  checked into 1.6.0.  This is what caused compilation and library
  problems for MANY people who tried 1.6.0.

1.6.0 
- *A LOT* of changes from Olav Andree Brevik. Thank you VERY much!
- Helicoptors loose 10% of hp per turn when outside city (Olav)

- upgrade units in active units dialog. allows you to upgrade your old out of
  date units, that is in a city square to a new and more modern version.
  will cost you some gold tho.. the side effect of this is leonardo's workshop
  which i'm still not sure if i want to incorporate or not.
- u for unload ship
- 'all' button on the wake up units
- Found one of the ancient gigantic bugs, and a fix for it 
  as it was, units didn't get a homecity on the server before the game was
  saved and reloaded, now this will help alot for the game balance. 
- Peter Skov fixed the problem with saving before game has started in a neat
  way by saving the settings instead of a game, this means you can make your
  favorite settings then save them to a file which you can use later on.
  with the -f server switch. 
- can't change all the map dependent options after the game has started.. 
- fixed a little problem with the help button on the science dialog.
- removed a bug that had sneaked into the support of units calculations.
- compiled it with some strict options and found a few minor bugs..
- added a civ1-2 switch but it doesn't do anything yet. need a voluenteer
  to do the civ1 tech tree and unit-building dependencies.
- The unit values  and the techtree has been checked and has been adjusted 
  according to civ 2.42 rules.

1.3.0
- Peter Skov added the following client features & server fixes
    * help in the city dialog on the units/buildings you can build.
    * a help toggle in the science dialog, if you turn it on, you won't change
      techs, rather it will show the help for this tech.
    * buy and change buttons in the city report, eases the pain of managing 
      your cities. 
    * there had sneaked a bug into top-5 cities, which has also been fixed

- port facility added, if naval unit is build in city with port facility
  unit will be veteran, repairment of a ship in a city with port facility
  only takes 1 turn
- Airport added on server, need to do a client command to activate them
  airborne units will be fully repaired in a city with a airport in 1 turn
  and will initially be veteran if build in a city with airport 
- new techs added radio, machine tools, amphibious warfare
- Shuffles players randomly at new turn, so the first player that connected
  doesn't get the wonder when 2 people are building the same wonder in the
  same round. 

1.2.0
- Extra fast unit info when middle clicking on an unit on the map 
  (attack, defense, firepower)
- Fortresses wasn't saved correctly in the save file.
- Cities are now properly refreshed at end of turn.
- can't buy units when cities are in disorder anymore.
- buildings unnecessary due to wonders like the granaries to pyramids, don't
  show on the build list anymore, if you have an unnecessary building already
  it will be marked with (*)
- autobuild  needed serious fixing, is better now. Still not ideal 
- Made a new mapgenerator, that works on minimum 80x50 maps
  which will make 7 equal sized islands. Still alot of fiddling to do with
  it but it should make things alot more fair.
  So set generator 2 to try the new map generator.
  And keep the number of players below 8....
- changed the "auto choose place to put worker algorithm" a bit now it
  favors huge amounts of trade and production over food.

1.1.6 (never released)
- SDI now give double defense against missile attacks, thats a 
  multiplier by 4 together with SAM batteries..
- SAM batteries added. Double defense against aircrafts
- supermarkets added. 50% food bonus on irrigated tiles
- Hoover dam can now be build, an and should have been an or :)
- Fixed problem with king richards crusade.
- Fixed problem with cruise missiles.
- Fixed problem with martial law under communism and monarchy 
- Fixed problem with wonders not seemingly working first turn after reload
- think i fixed the change tech stuff, now it's not reset on the client
  if you change tech in the round you get one.. Maybe..

1.1.5 (never released (except for 2 persons))
- the city growth can now be adjusted with the foodbox server option
  used instead of the standard 10 multiplier of citysize to determine when
  a city will grow
- number of buildings that will be razed if you conquer or loose a city is
  now a game variable, namely razechance. Palaces will always be destroyed..
- oops fortresses beneath cities gave 100% defense bonus. don't anymore
  units in cities and fortresses always count as fortified.
  coastal fortresses is needed to protect cities, a citywall just won't do
  it anymore. same count for bombers, but there is no defense against them.
  since SAM site haven't been made yet. 
- Hanging gardens converts content to happy if possible, other wonders
  converts unhappy to content.
- Caught in city, a ship used to have 1 in defense, now it has its usual 
  defense, but only 1 in firepower instead.
- Changed the messages when a unit(s) dies. (tells which city if on a city 
  square and what units died always)
- Found some crash bugs while debugging, goto could kill server if unit died 
  while gotoing. (my settler did a goto into a hut with barbarians)
- Changed obsolete tech test, to unit testing in the unit list.
  makes things easier, and more readable.
- remaining units, techs, buildings has been added, but looped..
  just to make sure future savefiles will be consistent, if we want to have 
  them in the game.
1.1.4 (beta tested by 4-5 persons)
- new flags:
  igwall    ignore citywalls, counts for artillery, 
  generates extra unhappy under  republic and democracy (as it has always been)
- happy/content/unhappy fixed according to civ2 rules, be careful out there,
  it's harder now to keep cities happy. 
  (took me a bloody sunday to figure how the exact formula works) 
- cruiser missiles was to cheap, costs 60 now instead of 40, 
  and their firepower is now 3, reduced its hp to 10.
- armor had firepower 2, fixed.
- carriers only 9 defense now, 2 firepower 40 hp's instead.

- got rid of year 0. A nasty hack was needed , but we were getting too many
  reports about it.

- percent penalty instead of 0 when changing tech default 100 
- foodbox server option default 10
- fixed a few bugs in mapgen.c (landmass and swamp is now used)

  o settlers costs 2 food under communism now.
  o cities did loose size by naval or air bombardements, doesn't anymore.

o cities did loose size by naval or air bombardements, doesn't anymore.
  o can only build fortresses after invention of construction
  o can't fortify naval or airborne units anymore.
  o happiness calculations was buggy, among other things colloseums gives
    +4 instead of +3 after development of electricty.
    the luxury and wonder happy calculations has been modified a bit..
  o cities only give a 50% bonus on defense, city walls still give a 200% bonus
    and since they don't cost much in maintainance. Go Build them.
  o movement changes:
    - unit move rates, scaled by lost hp's. allthough land based units have 
      atleast 1 move, naval units 2, and air units isn't affected
    - moves and fuel wasn't in the savefiles, they are now.
    - discover nuclear power and get + 1 move for naval units.

  o getting a city in a goody hut didn't add a road beneath the city.

o ver 1.0k - August 10
  o server freeze bug fixed thanks to Stefan Andersson.
  o various other bugs fixed too.

o ver 1.0j - Apr 8 
  o Pillage could be done by settlers only. This isn't correct, actually should
    be doable by all land based units, except settlers, caravans & diplomats..
  o Now units with 0 attack/defence power will ALWAYS loose in battle.
  o Reported By Andrew Donkin and patches aswell :).
    - Could make unlimited # of trade routes... Fixed 
    - Units gained hp by building fortresses not when fortified .... Fixed  
  o Problem with nukes, could nuke the server :). 
    Fixed (well not first time i said that) 
    (Reported By Christian Bricart).
  o Problems with list of available tech after getting techs one way or 
    another is hopefully fixed. (noone has been cheated, tech was correct, 
    but the researchable list was not updated.)
  o Tried to fix rolling thunder tactics. new server option cityfactor which
    modify the unhappysize this way: 
    newunhappysize = unhappysize - #cities/(cityfactor - (5-goverment))
    eg. under monarchy with 25 cities, unhappysize 5, cityfactor 14  
    you'll have a newunhappysize of 5 - 25/(14-(5-2)) = 3 ...
    that is lots of cities and low goverment forms, will give unhappiness. 
  o Diplomat treaties are unbalancing the game. Now you have a new variable 
    that can reduce the effect of tech-trading, techcost. Whenever you get a 
    free tech  it'll cost you techcost percent of a normal research cost, 
    to incorporate  it in your society. Standard this variable is 25%. 
    Setting it to 0 will  give you the standard behaviour. So don't look 
    startled if you suddenly have a negative number of tech bulbs.   
  o Tax-Trade-Luxury calculation tended to favor Tax when distributing. Fixed..
  o Goodie huts changed a bit: 
    - different units in huts depending on tech level.
    - no barbarians if hut is in city radius.
    - advanced tribes added.
  o Seperate Popup windows added (see the Game menu (Mes Options)), more to
    be added later.
  o Message Window added, with goto location button.  
  o fixed minor textual details
    (eg.when someone you have contact with gains tech)
  o autosettlers added, use this option at your own risk..
    Press A to activate them.
  o New server option cavalry, allows players to start with a number of 
    cavalry.
  o Game will not start before Minplayers has connected. 
  o buffed lighthouse, now owner will not loose triremes at sea. 
  o Diplomats will now be able to defend cities, against other diplomats.
  o Rivers only costs 1/3 movepoint to travel on.
  o Altered the startposition algorithm, should even out things abit.
    A side effect of this lets small maps eg 40x25 work, server used to loop..
    (well atleast for a reasonable amount of players)
o ver 1.0h - feb 16
  Massimo Campostrini once again supplied us with historical correct
  citynames - this time for the Aztecs.
  Proper error message when the xpm files can't be opened.
  Panner widget allow resizing of chat window.
  A huge pile of bugs, reported to us by Goswin Brederlow, has been

  something. 
  Game will end if only one player is alive.
  Announcement of building wonders now include which city that builds it.
  Notifies attacker if his attack was succesful or not
  resets light bulbs at end of turn if player gets a tech. 
  Check every turn if units on ocean has transporters enough.
  If wonder was autobuild it wouldn't be announced. (fixed)
  Bug in mapgen.c fixed, start positions could be real close.
  Added a steal flag to the city structure, can only be stolen once from
  every city now, restarts if the city has been conquered. Don't know if this
  is correct..
  Trade Routes are now modified according to the continental rules.
  (both cities on same continents halfes the output).
  Hoover dam and Michelangelo's Chapel only affects the continent
  on which they have been built.
  Gaining a free tech in huts worked before but gave a wrong message, 
  this has been fixed aswell.
  Fixed bug located by Robert Wilton, in unit_activity_text()
  Fixed zone of control bug, now you can always enter and leave a city.
