; Below: The individual advances, one per section.
; The number can be variable, up to 196.

; The actual tag used (the * in [advance_*]) does not matter, except 
; it must be unique within this file, and it may be used in debug 
; output when reading this file.

; Notes:
;
; name          = translatable name as seen by user
; rule_name     = (optional) name for savegames, rulesets etc; if not
;                 present, 'name' is used. Since the name used in savegames
;                 must not change, use this when renaming a tech after a
;                 ruleset has been released.
; req1, req2	= advances required before researching this one
; root_req      = tech required before acquiring this tech, by any
;     means, inherited by all techs that require this tech in turn unless
;     "None" is given here explicitly; and you can make a tech available
;     only through the init_tech of a nation by making it root_req itself.
; flags         = special flag strings
; graphic       = icon for technology
; graphic_alt   = alternate icon
; helptext	= optional help text string (set units ruleset for examples)
; bonus_message = text seen when a player is the first to 
;                 discover an bonus tech.
; cost          = if tech_cost_style is set to 2, this field is read for
;                 information on how much a tech costs
;
; Special values for req1 and req2 are "None" (first section below) 
; and "Never" (never available).  If only one tech is required, 
; it should be listed as req1.
;
; As well as custom flags defined above, the following flag strings are
; possible:
;
; "Bonus_Tech" = player gets extra tech if reached first
; "Bridge"   = "Settler" unit types can build roads with "RequiresBridge" flag
;              over roads with "PreventsOtherRoads" flag (rivers)
; "Farmland" = "Settler" unit types can build farmland
; "Population_Pollution_Inc" = Increase the pollution factor created by
;                              population by one
; "Build_Airborne" = from now on can build air units (for use by AI)
; "Claim_Ocean"    = Player claims ocean tiles even if they are not
;                    adjacent to border source
