; Modifying this file:
; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.

[datafile]
description="Alien World nations data for Freeciv"
options="+Freeciv-2.5-ruleset"

[compatibility]
; Initial government for all the nations that do not
; have it explicitly defined
default_government = "Despotism"

[default_traits]
; Default values for the AI traits. These are used if nation specific
; value for some trait has not been used. If these default too are
; not defined, the ultimate default is 50.

; Value of trait "expansionist" defines how much AI wants to settle new territory.
;expansionist = 50

; Value of trait "trader" defines how much AI wants to establish trade routes.
;trader = 50

; Value of trait "aggressive" defines how easily AI declares war.
;aggressive = 50


; Descriptions of nation sets
; These are self-contained subsets of the available nations; one of these
; can be chosen in pregame with the "nationset" option. No nations
; outside the selected subset will be used.
; The first set defined is the one that is used by default. It is mandatory
; to have at least one, but if there is only one, it will be kept out of
; the user's way.
; name 		= Translatable name of the set presented in the UI.
; rule_name     = Unique persistent name; this is also visible to users as
;                 the value of the "nationset" server option, and presented
;                 in "/list nationsets". It should thus be short, in lower
;                 case, and not contain spaces or punctuation.
;                 The same saved "nationset" setting may be used for multiple
;                 rulesets, so if your custom ruleset has any set which
;                 contains all of its nations, it is useful to give it a
;                 rule_name of "all" so that users can specify that they
;                 always want the choice of all available nations by
;                 default.
; description   = Optional short user description of this set.
