; Modifying this file:
; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or

; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.

; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more
; than minor changes.

; special movement costs for rivers:

;   2 - 1/3 movement cost directly along river, 2/3 for diagonals (this
;       is effectively the same as '1', as if you had done the two moves,
;       except for differences relating to ZOC, etc.)

; Below: The individual terrain types, one per section.
; For now, the number of such sections must be kept the same (=12).
; Also, terrains should be in the same order as defined in common/map.h,
; and have similar roles/effects, as some things are still hardwired.
; The actual tag used (the * in [terrain_*]) does not matter, except
