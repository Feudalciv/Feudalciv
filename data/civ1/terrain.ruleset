; Modifying this file:
; You shouldn't modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes,
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "set terrain <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.

; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more
; than minor changes.

; Tile_type list:
;
; Tile terrains should be in the same order as defined in common/map.h
; and have similar roles/effects, as some things are still hardwired.
;
; Special terrain_name value: "unused" -- terrain type is not used.
; The defense_bonus value is 10 times the actual defense bonus.
; Special special_#_name value: "none" -- special type is not used.
; Special *_time value: 0 -- operation is not allowed.
; Special *_result value: "no" -- operation is not allowed.
; Special *_result value: "yes" -- operation is permitted, but it doesn't change the terrain type.
