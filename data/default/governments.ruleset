; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.

; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more
; than minor changes.

; Below: The individual government types, one per section.
;
; The actual tag used (the * in [government_*]) does not matter, except 
; it must be unique within this file, and it may be used in debug 
; output when reading this file.
;
; For the "official" rulesets, the order of these sections should not
; be changed because that would break backward compatability with 
; savegames.  (In particular, if Fundamentalism is added to default
; ruleset, should be added at end.)

;		  upkeep forms
; unit_free_*   = base unit upkeep cost which the city gets "free"; only

; corruption:
 
; _level            = percentage factor applied to corruption multiplied 
;		      by 100; if 0, Courthouse effect changes
; _fixed_distance   = if non-zero, used instead of actual calculation of 
;		      distance from Palace; also used for distances in 
;		      unit and city bribe cost calculations
; _distance_factor  = multiply distance by this factor for corruption 
;		      (but not bribe costs)
; _extra_distance   = add this to distance after applying distance factor
; _max_distance_cap = cap to the max distance from the capital used in
;                     corruption calculation

; production_*_bonus   = added to base production for each worked tile;
;			 second value is used instead when city is celebrating
; production_*_penalty = if non-zero, tile production above this amount is 
;			 reduced by one; second value used when celebrating

; ruler_titles = ruler titles by nation, "-" is default, and non-matched
