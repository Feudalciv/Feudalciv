; A specialist is a city citizen who is not a tile worker.  Usually the
; player can control what specialist each citizen is, so long as the
; requirements for that specialist are met.
;
; Below are the entries for the specialists, one per specialist type.
; The tag name (in [specialist_*]) doesn't matter so long as it's unique.
; For each specialist the following fields may be set:
;
; 
; name          = translatable name as seen by user
; rule_name     = (optional) name for savegames, rulesets etc; if not
;                 present, 'name' is used. Since the name used in savegames
;                 must not change, use this when renaming a specialist after a
;                 ruleset has been released.
; short_name    = one-character "short name" used (for instance) in cityrep
; reqs		= requirements to have the specialist pick (see
;		  effects.ruleset and README.effects for help on requirements)
