#Freeciv
Freeciv is a turn-based strategy game, in which each player becomes
the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
The extinction of all other civilizations.

#Playing the game
While every game is different, there's a basic strategy which most 
players follow, especially at the start of the game.

These steps may vary depending upon the server options, but in
general, the steps are:

 0. Choosing the first city site.
 1. Mapping the countryside.
 2. Defending the cities.
 3. Units to build first.
 4. Agriculture improvements.

 5. Where to build?
 6. Taking care of cities.
 7. Exploring the world.
 8. Things to keep in mind.
 9. Make your own strategy for the game.
 
 
 0. Choosing the first city site.

    Start the game by wandering around BRIEFLY to find a good place
    to build the first city.  Don't feel tempted to investigate any
    yellow-roofed villages yet - they might contain barbarian
    tribes.  Build the city close to resources and perhaps close to
    the sea.  Keep in mind that the city you build first will be
    your capitol!  The idea is to balance the time spent looking for
    a good site, against getting your first city established as
    early as possible.

 1. Mapping the countryside.

    After the capitol city has been founded, it will start producing
    a warrior unit.  These units can be used to rove around
    exploring the countryside.  Remember, it is NOT a good idea to
    leave a city undefended, so keep the first warrior in the city,
    and use the following one to explore.

 2. Defending the cities.

    At this point, defend your cities by always leaving a warrior
    unit in them.  As your civilization develops units with a
    greater defence strength, replace the obsolete units with new
    ones to ensure your cities have maximum defence.  The units most
    often used for defence are (in order of strength):  Warrior,
    Phalanx, Musketeers, and Riflemen.

    Keep in mind that with some types of government, military units
    in the city create unhappiness.  Also remember that when a unit
    is inside a city, its defence strength is doubled.  When a new
    city is build, the city starts to build a unit with the best
    defence strength.

 3. Units to build first.

    After building one or two Warrior units, start building
    Settlers.  The second Settler can be used to build roads and
    irrigate the farmland close to the city, and the third can be
    used to build a new city.  Or, you can use the second Settler to
    build another city, and use the third Settler for agricultural
    improvements in the farmland around the cities.  Keep in mind
    that a large population increases both the amount of
    productivity and the your civilization's research rate.

 4. Agriculture improvements.

    Each city has an area of farmland around it that can be used
    for growing food, producing goods, and generating trade.  This
    can be increased by using Settlers to improve the farmland. 
    The land can be improved with roads, irrigation, mines, and
    others.
    

 5. Where to build cities?

    The best location for a city is a matter of taste.  A city which
    is placed near the sea is easier to spot by opponents, but can
    also serve as a port for sea-going units.  (They also usually
    need a harbour defence later on).  The best strategy is to build
    a few of both, but keep in mind that your opponents will find it
    harder to locate your city if you don't build it by the sea. 

 6. Taking care of cities.

    Every city has a band of citizens.  The number of citizens
    depends on the city's population.  When you click on a city, you
    can see how the farmland around the city is being used.  You can
    assign your citizens to the farmland, or they can be scientists,
    entertainers or taxmen.  Especially at the start of the game,
    care should be taken to ensure that the citizens are employed so
    that they maximise growth, trade and production.

    If too much food is being generated, a citizen can be taken off
    the farmland by clicking on the occupied farmland square.  This
    citizen can then be transferred to the other duties mentioned
    previously.

    If you move all of your citizens into the city and right-click
    on the central tile of the farmland, the citizens will be
    rearranged to maximise food production.

    The golden rule of taking care of a city is that there should be
    at least as many happy citizens as unhappy citizens.  A city
    where this is not so is labeled with a lightning bolt.  Take
    care not to let this happen to any of your cities, as unhappy
    cities produce nothing, and will soon revolt.

 7. Explore the world.

    Aftr you have fortified your cities with troops, build Triremes
    in the cities near the sea.  Use the Triremes to map the world
    in search of opponents and new lands.  If you are on an island,
    you should spend less on military and more on expansion.  Or if
    you are located close to an opponent, it is truly a good idea to
    make a peace treaty and share the Advances you have made.
    Diplomat units are very useful here, and WILL pay off later.

 8. Things to keep in mind.

    - What the next Advance you'll need is.

    - What your luxury, tax and research rates are currently set to.

    - Treaty are often broken, so don't neglect defence...

    - Some Wonders can be made obsolete by the development of
      certain advances.

 9. Make your own strategy for the game.      

    These basic concepts will allow you to play the game pretty
    well, especially in the beginning of the game.  But to improve,
    you need to study the various units and advances, and PRACTICE,
    PRACTICE, PRACTICE!  Freeciv has many twists, so if you haven't
    played a simular game before, try consulting the Freeciv WWW

    You'll find more tips for playing, and details of how to contact

#Copying

Freeciv is covered by the GPL, which is included here:

                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                      Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can
apply it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and
passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear
that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work
based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation
is included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
    any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
    provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
    under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is
    interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
    your work based on the Program is not required to print an
    announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work
based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the
terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
    interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
    offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This
    alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
    only if you received the program in object code or executable
    form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as
a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

#City Improvements
City Improvements are built in each of your cities to improve trade
revenue, science production, etc.  Each improvement requires you to 
pay an upkeep every turn.  If you can't afford the upkeep for a 
building, then it'll be automatically sold.
%% Hmm, "sold" as in "you get money for it", or is it actually lost?
%% Does the player get any money back for it, as when they actually sell
%% an Improvement, or is it lost forever?  If it's lost, then "automatically
%% sold" should be "lost".
---
# Airport
Allows a city to produce veteran air units.

Two cities with airports can airlift one unit per turn. 
Airlifting instantly transports the unit from one city to another
and will use all of the unit's MP.  A unit must have some MP left
to be airlifted.
---
# Aqueduct
Allows a city to grow larger than size 8.
---
# Bank
Together with the Marketplace improvement, a Bank increases the
generated luxuries and taxes within a city by 100%.
---
# Barracks
With a Barracks, each new unit built in a city will automatically 
have Veteran status, which means that its attack and defence 
strengths are increased by 50%.

Note that discovering Gunpowder and Combustion will obsolete 
any existing Barracks.
---
# Barracks II
With a Barracks, each new unit built in a city will automatically 
have Veteran status, which means that its attack and defence 
strengths are increased by 50%.

The discovery of Combustion will make Barracks II obsolete.
---
# Barracks III
With a Barracks, each new unit built in a city will automatically 
have Veteran status, which means that its attack and defence 
strengths are increased by 50%.
---
# Capitalization
Converts all production into taxes income.
%% Not sure about this English.
---
# Cathedral
A Cathedral makes 3 unhappy citizens content in a city, making it 
easier to maintain order in that city.  The discovery of COMMUNISM 
will reduce this by 1, while the discovery of THEOLOGY will increase 
this by 1.
---
# City Walls
City Walls make it easier to defend a city.  They triple the defence
strength of units within the city against ground and helicopter
units.  They are uneffective aginst airborne and sea units as well
as Howitzers.  City Walls also prevent the loss of population which
occurs when a defending unit is destroyed.
---
# Coastal Defense
Increases the defence strength of units within a city by a factor
of 2 when defending against bombardments from enemy ships.
---
# Colosseum
Entertains the citizens of a city, making 3 unhappy citizens
content.  Increased by 1 upon the discovery of ELECTRICITY.
---
# Courthouse
Reduces the corruption in a city by 50%.  Under a Democracy, a
Courthouse makes 1 unhappy citizen content.  
Also halves the effective distance to the capital, for the purpose
of calculating revolt cost.
---
# Factory
Increases the resources produced in a city by 50%.  Also contributes
to pollution.
---
# Granary
If a city has a granary, then when it grows or shrinks, the amount
of stored food will be set to half full.  This helps a city to grow 
faster, and withstand famine more easily.
---
# Harbour
Gives one food resource extra on all water terrain-types.  
---
# Hydro Plant
Reduces the amount of pollution generated in a city.  It also
increase the production generated by a factory or Mfg. Plant in the 
city by 50%.
A city can only have one Hydro Plant, or a Power Plant, or a 
Nuclear Plant.
---
# Library
Increases the knowledge production in a city by 50%
---
# Marketplace
Increases the generated luxuries and taxes in a city by 50%.  
---
# Mass Transit
Neutralises the pollution generated by the population.
The population simply has no effect on the pollution generated in
the city.
---
# Mfg. Plant
Together with a factory, a Manufacturing Plant increases the
resource production in a city by 100%.
---
# Nuclear Plant
Increases the production generated by a Factory or Mfg. Plant
by 50%.  It lowers the chance of pollution occuring, but has a
great risk melting down when the government is in Anarchy.
A city can only have one Hydro Plant, or a Power Plant, or a 
Nuclear Plant.
---
# Offshore Platform
Adds 1 to shield production on all ocean squares in a city.
The city needs to be coastal to build this improvement.
---
# Palace
Makes a city the capitol and the centre of your government.
Corruption in other cities is related to how far away from the
capitol they are, except when the Government is a Democracy or under
Communism.
---
# Police Station
Reduces the unhappiness generated by units in a city by 1.
Effective only when the Government is a Republic or a Democracy.
---
# Port Facility
Allows a city to build veteran sea units.
---
# Power Plant
Increases the production generated by a factory or Mfg. Plant
in the city by 50%. It also increases the amount of pollution 
generated by the city.
A city can only have one Hydro Plant, or a Power Plant, or 
a Nuclear Plant.
---
# Recycling Center
Building a recycling centre reduces the amount of pollution 
generated by a city by 65%.

#Wonders of the World
Each Wonder has specific benefits for your civilization.
Each Wonder is unique and is placed in the city which 
constructed it.
---
# A.Smith's Trading Co.
City Improvements which have an upkeep of 1, are free of upkeep.
---
# Apollo Program
All cities on the map becomes visible.
---
# Colossus
Each square around the city where this Wonder is build, produces
one extra trade resource.

Works as a City Wall in all cities.
---
# Hanging Gardens
Makes one unhappy or content citizen happy.
Makes 2 extra happy faces in the city containing the Hanging
Gardens.
---
# Hoover Dam

---
# Manhattan Project
Allow all players with sufficient knowledge to create Nuclear units.
---

The discovery of THEOLOGY  will increase this by 1.
---
# Oracle
Doubles the effect of Temples.
---
# Pyramids
Counts as having a Granary in every city.
---
# SETI Program
Counts as having a Research Lab in all of your cities.  That is,
it boots science in each city by 50%.
---

Democracy.  Reduced by 1 under all other form governments.
---
#Units
Units can be used for three purposes: Attack, Defense, and
Reconnaisance.  How useful a particular Unit is for each of these
roles, depends on the Unit's strength in attack, defense and it's
ability to move.
---
# AEGIS Cruiser
Doubles defence against missiles.
---
# Alpine Troops
Alpine Troops treat all squares as if they have roads.
---
# Archers
---
# Armor
---
# Artillery
---
# Battleship
This unit ignores the effect of City Walls.
---
# Bomber
This unit ignores the effect of City Walls.  If a Bomber is not able
to refuel in a city or on a Carrier unit by the end of its second
turn, it runs out of fuel and is lost.
---
# Cannon
---
# Caravan
Used to establish trade routes and help build Wonders.
Every caravan that is used to build a Wonder will add 50
shields towards the production of the Wonder.

TIP: A well-known strategy is to build Wonders in one turn, by
     stockpiling a stack of caravans, then bringing them all
     into the city where the Wonder is to be built.
---
# Caravel
---
# Carrier
The Carrier can carry up to 8 airborne Units.

TIP: Guard Carriers with a handful of fast-moving ships and a
     battleship, as losing a fully-equipped Carrier is VERY
     painful and expensive.
---
# Catapult
---
# Cavalry
---
# Chariot
---
# Cruise Missile
If a Cruise Missile is unable to end its turn in a city or on a
Carrier or Submarine unit, it runs out of fuel and is lost.

TIP: A handful of these can successfully keep the waters around
     your treasured homeland free of enemy ships.
---
# Cruiser
---
# Crusaders
---
# Destroyer
TIP: A very fast unit, which is very useful for hunting down enemy
     Transports.
---
# Diplomat
 - A Diplomat can establish embassies with other civilizations
   by moving into another player's city.

 - Diplomats can also try to sabotage enemy production, or steal
   an Advance from an enemy city.  (An Advance can only be stolen once
   per city).

 - A diplomat can also bribe an enemy unit, if that unit is the only
   one on its square.

 - Diplomats can even start a revolution in an enemy city and turn
   it into your own, if you have the money!

 - Diplomats ignore the zone of control.
%% Should include entry for zoc, and a cross-reference here.

 - In some game strategies, hordes of Diplomats can be used to wreak
   havoc on the enemy.  Little wonder that Diplomats are often
   viewed with suspicion and fear!
---
# Dragoons
%%---
%%# Elephants
%%We've chosen not to implement these fierce animals.
---
# Engineers
Just like Settlers, except these guys work twice as fast and move
twice as fast. 

TIP 1: Upgrade Settlers to Engineers when possible, as Engineers
       require the same resources as ordinary Settlers.

TIP 2: If you manage to build Leonardo's Workshop, research
       Explosives before the Workshop becomes obsolete.  This way,
       your Settler units will be upgraded for free.
---
# Explorer
Treats all terrain as if it had roads.  A very useful unit for
mapping unknown territory.
%%---
%%# Fanatics
%% This unit isn't in the game.  They are even fiercer animals than 
%% the Elephant!! :-)
---
# Fighter
If a Fighter is unable to end its turn in a city or on a Carrier 
unit, it runs out of fuel and is lost.
---
# Freight
Used to establish trade routes, or help build Wonders.  The Freight
unit replaces the Caravan, and moves at twice the speed.
---
# Frigate
---
# Galleon
---
# Helicopter
The Helicopter is a very powerful unit, as it can both fly and
conquer cities.  Care must be exercised, because Helicopters lose a
small amount of health for every turn not spent in a city.
---
# Horsemen
---
# Howitzer
This unit ignores the effect of City Walls.
---
# Ironclad
---
# Knights
---
# Legion
---
# Marines
---
# Mech. Inf.
This unit has the strongest defence strength of any land unit, but
is only available near the very end of the technology tree.
---
# Musketeers
---
# Nuclear
If a Nuclear unit is unable to end its turn in a city or on a
Carrier or Submarine unit, it runs out of fuel and is lost.
On impact, the blast will destroy any unit in a 3x3-square area,
including friendly units.  When striking a city, the city size is
halved, and the surrounding squares are polluted.

TIP 1: Nuking the ocean will not generate pollution, and is a most
       effective (but expensive!!) way of getting rid of enemy 
       ships.

TIP 2: You may be involved in a situation where you've invaded an
       enemy country en masse, but the enemy cities are too strong.
       Before using a Nuclear unit, assemble a gang of Settlers
       and/or Engineers next to the city and have them ready to fix
       the pollution on the same turn it occurs!  This minimises the
       chance of global warming.  Eco-friendly nukes!
%%---
%%# Paratroopers
%% Not implemented, simply too powerful.
---
# Partisan
A number of partisans are granted free when an enemy conquers your
city.
---
# Phalanx
---
# Pikemen
The defence of these units is doubled if attacked by horseback
units.
---
# Riflemen
---
# Settlers
Used to found new cities, build roads, irrigate land and
build mines.  One of the key units in the game.
---
# Spy
An improved Diplomat, which has an extra move point.  (On speed?)
---
# Stealth Bomber
An improved Bomber, with more firepower and a higher movement
radius.
---
# Stealth Fighter
An improved Fighter, with more firepower and a higher movement
radius.
---
# Submarine
This unit is invisible unless the enemy is very close.  It can
carry up to 8 missiles.  This unit has a very high strategic value,
but has a weak defence.
---
# Transport
This unit can convey up to 8 land-based units across water.
---
# Trireme
Special: Triremes have a 50% risk of being lost at sea unless they
end their turn next to a coast or in a port.
---
# Warriors
This unit may be built from the start of the game.  It is the
weakest unit.
