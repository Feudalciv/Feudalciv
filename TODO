THINGS TO DO
============

Freeciv is quite mature, and we think its already a great game,
but there are always things to add or improve.  This file lists
some new features which are being worked on, or are planned, or
desired.  (See also the file BUGS, for some known deficiencies.)

TODO:
=====

- Sound support.
- Server-side player scripting.
- Diplomacy:
  * Senate
  * AI handle diplomacy
  * Automatically shared vision between allies
- Better graphics for city styles.
- Better internationalization (fix some problems, modify those
  English sentences which can not be translated into most other
  languages, better gui handling for different-length words,
  mixed language client-server, more complete translations,
  more languages).
- Make the rulesets for City Improvements and Wonders more flexible.
- Extend governments ruleset to allow Fundamentalism, and fix up AI
  handling of variant governments.
- Ports to Win32 and Mac are being worked on.
