THINGS TO DO
============

Freeciv is quite mature, and we think its already a great game,
but there are always things to add or improve.  This file lists 
some new features which are being worked on, or are planned, or 
desired.  (See also the file BUGS, for some known deficiencies.)

TODO:

- Internationalization (that is, multi-language support).
- Make the government types configurable via rulesets.
- Make the existing rulesets more flexible, especially for
  City Improvements and Wonders.
- Make the races/tribes/leaders/city-names configurable.
- Allow alliances between players.
- City Plans and other client improvements.
- Ports to Win32 and Mac are being worked on.

Information on other projects, and the Freeciv development 
"roadmap", are available at the Freeciv website:
