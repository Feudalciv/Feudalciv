THINGS TO DO
============

Freeciv is quite mature, and we think its already a great game,
but there are always things to add or improve.  This file lists 
some new features which are being worked on, or are planned, or 
desired.  (See also the file BUGS, for some known deficiencies.)

TODO:

- City build lists.
- Sound support.
- Barbarians.
- Alliances between players.
- Better graphics for city styles.
- Better internationalization (fix some problems, better gui 
  handling for different-length words, mixed language client-server,
  more complete translations, more languages).
- Make the rulesets for City Improvements and Wonders more flexible.
- Extend governments ruleset to allow Fundamentalism, and fix up AI 
  handling of variant governments.
- Ports to Win32 and Mac are being worked on.

"roadmap", are available at the Freeciv website:
