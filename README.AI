    1.6.4 is not a stable version, and does not necessarily have
a stable AI.  The AI will still do stupid things that I know it
shouldn't but haven't had time to correct yet.  If it does something
stupid that isn't referred to on this list, send me mail describing
the problem and attach a save file so I can take a look at it.
As many of the following as possible will be fixed before the
1.7.0 release on the 26th.  If you have opinions on which problems
are most important, send me mail about it.  I'm always happy to
get user feedback.
