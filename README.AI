    While I've done quite a lot of work since 1.6.3, the AI is far
from complete.  It's finally competent, at least, although there are
certain situations it still doesn't handle well.  Over the final hours
before the 1.7.0 release, I tried to teach it to handle a number of
unusual cases, many of which haven't been tested.  If it does something
stupid or questionable that isn't referred to as a Known Problem,
send me mail describing the problem and attach a save file so I can
take a look at it.  If you have opinions on which of the below are most
important, send me mail about it.  I'm always happy to get user feedback.

    The AI difficulty levels aren't fully implemented.  I've done all my
work getting the default level to work right, and based on what I've
heard, I defined that level as 'hard'.  I made some minor changes to
get the AI to acknowledge 'normal', but I don't know if it's going
to behave reasonably at that level or not.  It seems to, but 'normal'
mode has only existed for a few hours, so it hasn't really been tested.
There is no 'easy' mode yet, although I suspect there needs to be.

Known problems:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI doesn't understand when to become DEMOCRACY
Cities don't realize units are on their way to defend it
AI doesn't understand obsolescence
related: AI likes to build Oracle more than Chapel
AI doesn't know how to use spies and diplomats, even for defense
AI doesn't know how to use planes and missiles
AI doesn't understand how to favor trade when it needs luxury
AI builds cities without regard to danger at that location
city tile values are not cached; wastes CPU time
Food tiles should be less wanted if city can't expand
AI doesn't build infrastructure near where a city is about to be built
ai_calc* routines are slow and perhaps shouldn't regard government
AI won't build cross-country roads outside of city radii
Non-military units need to stop going where they will be killed
GOTO doesn't popup diplomat/caravan dialog when city is reached
Locally_zero_minimap is not implemented when wilderness tiles change
AI doesn't understand 13th city is unlucky
Settlers won't treat about-to-be-built ferryboats as ferryboats
If no path to chosen victim is found, new victim should be chosen
Values for Mysticism, Electricity, and Theology need to be verified
AI doesn't know how to make trade routes or when
AI is vulnerable to well co-ordinated mass attacks
AI doesn't acknowledge effects of MAGELLAN in some of its calculations
Boats sometimes sail away from landlocked would-be passengers
Transport paranoia code is mostly working but not 100% reliable
Ferryboats crossing at sea might lead to unwanted behavior

Partially fixed problems:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI handicaps are not implemented
AI manages workers one at a time, which is not as dumb as it used to be

Recently fixed problems:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Caravans still waste turns helping with wonders
Ferryboats remain on GOTO even after their passengers leave
Settlers sometimes leave ferryboats too early just because they can
When aboard ship, settlers calculate distances stupidly.
Only ground units and ferryboats should be grave or urgent danger
AI disbands units it can't upkeep rather than scrapping them
Other cities should avail tiles to prevent famine or disorder
AI doesn't really understand the consequences of pollution yet
Something mungs the minimap
Move costs were not being reset when a city was created or destroyed
AI cities occasionally repeatedly have and resolve emergencies
AI doesn't attack enough
AI doesn't co-ordinate city defenders
Only settlers use ferryboats when ground forces also should
AI doesn't understand it needs ground forces to take over cities
Bodyguard and charge are not yet implemented
AI doesn't co-ordinate attacking forces
In the near <city> combat messages, <city> may be unknown.
Explorer routine should be available to players from the client
Boats with both settlers and attackers aboard misbehave
AI's economic rates are not limited by government
Desire to build units to attack wounded enemy units was buggy
In obscure circumstances, failed to find elvis pos even when it exists
Asymmetry in move costs caused the AI to misjudge danger sometimes
AI wouldn't buy units when danger was exactly equal to defense
AI has widespread disorder when Railroad/Theology obsoletes a wonder
AI buys extra defenders when it could instead buy walls
AI will spend 1000 gold to buy a battleship for defense of a city
Auto-settlers know tiles are irrigable even if water source is unseen

Idea space:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friendly cities can be used as beachheads
It might be best to only sentry the #1 passenger and its bodyguard
Unit_move_turns should be implemented more thorougly
Assume to-be-built ground attackers are veterans once gunpowder is learned
Assess_danger should acknowledge positive feedback between multiple attackers
Urgency and grave_danger should probably be ints showing magnitude of danger
It would be nice for bodyguard and charge to meet en-route more elegantly
It may be correct to starve workers instead of allowing disorder to continue

For land attacks, a chariot might be better than a catapult, but
for sea attacks it's probably worse.  Correct might be two fstk calls,
one which forbids ferryboating, and one which almost demands it.
