Welcome to Freeciv 1.6!

Thanks again to all our developers, who continue to work so hard.

For 1.6, a _lot_ of bugs have been fixed, new features added, and thanks
to John Stonebraker, the AI is ever-increasingly capable.

Those who are interested in seeing the detailed changes should check
the ChangeLog file.

KNOWN BUGS:

1.6.1 is still not completely bug-free, and there are a couple of
known bugs in this release:
 - When compiling with the experimental "configure" script, keyboard
   input is ignored.
 - There's possibly a problem with worker placement in the city dialog.

Please report problems to the Freeciv mailing list.  See:
