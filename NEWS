Welcome to Freeciv 1.8!

This is release 1.8.0.

Freeciv is under new leadership!  After leading the freeciv project 
from around version 1.5.2 through to version 1.7.2, Mitch Davis has 
handed over the reins.  Mitch writes:

   I will be cutting way back on my Freeciv activities, to have 
   more time for my family, and for another project.  Please welcome 
   Nicolas Brunel, who has offered to lead the Freeciv project.  
   Nicolas will be sharing the work with stalwart David Pfitzner.

Thanks heaps Mitch, for all your work!  Thanks again also to all our 
developers, who continue to work so hard.

Other general news since the previous release:

- The Freeciv website has been completely re-done ("FWNG"), and is 
now being frequently updated.

- Freeciv has a new manual.  The manual is too big to include in the
freeciv distribution, so it is available separately at the Freeciv 
web site and by ftp.

- Freeciv now has a map editor.  It is called Civworld, and is also
available separately at the freeciv ftp site.

Release news:

In this release, there are many enhancements, including civil war, 
space race, and a log of the game.  We have also tried to improve 
the graphics of freeciv with 2 beautiful tile sets.  And, as usual,
there are lots of bug fixes!

Those who are interested in seeing the detailed changes should check
the ChangeLog file.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.7.2:

 - Space race!  Be the first player to build a space ship and colonize 
   Alpha Centauri. 
 - Civil war!  Capturing the enemy capital may split his empire.  Half 
   of his towns will join a new AI leader!
 - Two tile sets in this release! The "big" ones are from Ralph Engels.  
   I hope you will enjoy them.  The second set is an enhancement of the 
   classic tiles.  The server option -tiles allows to choose a subdirectory 
   of the data directory to use different tiles.  (The data directory can 
   be set with the DATADIR environment variable.)  Also, diagonal roads 
   and railroads are now drawn.  Changed some of the national flags 
   (especially changed Soviet flag to the Russian flag for Russians).
 - Rulesets can be used to customise units, advances, wonders, and 
   improvements without recompiling -- see README.rulesets.
 - Units in a town can be put in auto-attack mode.  In this mode, they 
   will attack any enemy units which come nearby.
 - New city options for each city, controlling whether new citizens are 
   workers or specialists, whether to allow disbanding a size 1 city by 
   building a settler, and options for units on auto-attack mode in the 
   city.
 - Mapgen 4 (selected with the server command "set generator 4") is a new 
   map generator which generates a map with 2 players on each island.
 - Cities can be a traded in diplomatic treaties.  This effectively allows 
   you to exchange, sell or buy cities. 
 - The AI now builds diplomats to defend against enemy diplomats.
 - Settlers and engineers can do teamwork.  With enough manpower, all 
   terrain improvements can be done fast!
 - With engineers, the terrain type can be changed using the new Transform
   command ('O').  For example, hills can be turned into plains.
 - Units only regenerate hit points if they have not moved at all for a 
   full turn.
 - Gamelog option.  The whole history of a game can be stored in the 
   gamelog file. 
 - One can select a unit with 0 moves left from the main map.
 - City workers can be adjusted from the main map, with shift+button1.
 - Changed the order of libraries to fix problems on IRIX and Cygwin.
 - Changed the client-server protocol to use network byte order.
 - Other bug fixes and code and help text cleanups.


WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.7.1:

 - Improvements to the configure script, so it should now work
   properly on all systems.  
 - Ability to configure to use Xaw3d instead of the normal Xaw.
 - New "easy" AI mode, which is now the default.
 - Improved "City Report" dialog, with configurable columns.
 - Improved "Message Options" dialog, with customizable filtering and 
   selection for the different message types.
 - Improved "Messages" dialog, with a scrollbar, and a "Popup City" button.
 - Improved multi-column "Unit Select" dialog when there are lots of units.
 - In city dialog, middle-click unit icons to "activate and close".
 - New client command "t" to show tiles used by city under mouse.
 - New metaserver dialog to make connecting to metaserver games easier.
 - Ability to save and re-load client settings.
 - Clearer Yes/No toggle buttons in various places in the client.
 - Reduced color usage (but looks almost identical), so the client should 
   now work fine on systems with 8 bit color displays.
 - Ability to use "scenarios", that is, pre-designed maps.  Scenarios 
   for Earth and Europe games are included in the data directory.
   (Use them with the server command-line option -f, like savegames.)
 - More city names, so you're less likely to see "City 41" etc.
 - Saving large games is now much faster, and the savefile is smaller.
 - Improvements to the documentation and online help system, including
   a new help section on the "Zones of Control" game concept.
 - Detect repeated log messages and print repeat counts.
 - New server options randseed and aqueductloss.
 - Many other enhancements and bug fixes.
  
WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.7.0:

 - Removed two C++-style comments, the most reported problem with 1.7.0!
 - Tweaks to the configure script for Solaris, although it's still not perfect.
 - Spy and diplomat improvements.
 - Added the "W" command, which Wakes up sentried units, 
 - Added the "scorelog" command, which can be read by a script to generate
   power graphs after the game.
 - Loading games is now MUCH faster.
 - AI improvements from John Stonebraker.
 - Visual improvements to dialogs and the map screen.
 - Settlers may not fortify.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.6.3:

 - Massive AI changes. It plays smarter, and the AI uses seagoing vessels.

 - Many bugs fixed.
 - We now recommend you use "configure" instead of Imake.
 - Settlers have a new "e"xplore mode.
 - The makefiles now contain auto-generated dependency information.
 - Units within the radius of the city to which they belong no longer
   cause unhappiness.  This will allow much more realistic defense
   scenarios.
 - The tax/lux/sci rates are now limited by your government type.
   Also, they can modified by clicking on the rate status icons.
 - The behaviour of spies and diplomats has been greatly improved.
 - Freeciv now needs to transmit a lot less data (<25%!) when playing
   over the Internet.  This will greatly speed up games.

   when used in conjunction with the GNU tools.
 - From now on, it will be possible for different Freeciv versions to
   talk to each other if they're able.
 - Tracy Reed (who provides www.freeciv.org) reports that our site is
   getting over 6,000 hits per month.  He was quoted as saying "Cool!
   Now my computer is doing something!"
 - Lots, and Lots, and Lots of donated patches. Thanks guys, keep 'em 
   coming!
