Welcome to Freeciv 1.7!

Thanks again to all our developers, who continue to work so hard.

For 1.7, a _lot_ of bugs have been fixed, new features added, and thanks
to John Stonebraker, the AI is now so powerful that you'll probably want
to handicap it. :-)

Those who are interested in seeing the detailed changes should check
the ChangeLog file.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.6.3:

 - Massive AI changes. It plays smarter, and the AI uses seagoing vessels.  
 - The contents of the help system have been improved substantially.
 - Many bugs fixed.
 - We now recommend you use "configure" instead of Imake.
 - Settlers have a new "e"xplore mode.
 - The makefiles now contain auto-generated dependency information.
 - Units within the radius of the city to which they belong no longer
   cause unhappiness.  This will allow much more realistic defense
   scenarios.
 - The tax/lux/sci rates are now limited by your government type.
   Also, they can modified by clicking on the rate status icons.
 - The behaviour of spies and diplomats has been greatly improved.
 - Freeciv now needs to transmit a lot less data (<25%!) when playing
   over the Internet.  This will greatly speed up games.
 - Preliminary support for compiling Freeciv under Windows and OS/2,
   when used in conjunction with the GNU tools.
 - From now on, it will be possible for different Freeciv versions to
   talk to each other if they're able.
 - Tracy Reed (who provides www.freeciv.org) reports that our site is
   getting over 6,000 hits per month.  He was quoted as saying "Cool!
   Now my computer is doing something!"
 - Lots, and Lots, and Lots of donated patches. Thanks guys, keep 'em 
   coming!

KNOWN BUGS:

Freeciv 1.7 is the first stable release since 1.6.3, and is considered
bug-free enough for everyday use.

However if you do find one, please report it (or other problems) to
the freeciv-dev mailing list.  For instructions on how to do this, see:

  http://www.freeciv.org

THINGS TO DO:

 - goto should be looked at, as units with moves left after a goto should
   be active but aren't.
 - Alliances, the Space Race, and more!!
