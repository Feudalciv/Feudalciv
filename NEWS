Welcome to Freeciv 1.6!

Thanks again to all our developers, who continue to work so hard.

For 1.6, a _lot_ of bugs have been fixed, new features added, and thanks
to John Stonebraker, the AI is ever-increasingly capable.

Those who are interested in seeing the detailed changes should check
the ChangeLog file.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.6.2:

 - Fixed a bug with city squares being irrigated.
 - Mines may now be pillaged.
 - AI Explorers are smarter.
 - Fixed a segfault if an enemy city is destroyed.
 - Cleanup of the way we include xpm.h.
 - Made unit properties much closer to Civ II.  In particular, the HP of
   knights has been reduced from 20 to 10.
 - 1.6.2 incorrectly reported itself as 1.6.1.
 - Removed a redundant copy of mapgen.c from common/.
 - Fixed a nasty bug with unsigned chars on some machines.
 - Other assorted AI fixes.

KNOWN BUGS:

While we're not saying Freeciv 1.6.3 is bug-free, we believe it's stable
enough to be considered safe for everyday use.

However if you do find one, please report it (or other problems) to
the Freeciv mailing list.  See:

  http://freeciv.ultraviolet.org

THINGS TO DO:

 - goto should be looked at, as units with moves left after a goto should
   be active but aren't.

 - There may be some problem with cities being irrigated.
