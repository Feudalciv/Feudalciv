Welcome to Freeciv 1.6!

Thanks again to all our developers, who continue to work so hard.

For 1.6, a _lot_ of bugs have been fixed, new features added, and thanks
to John Stonebraker, the AI is ever-increasingly capable.

Those who are interested in seeing the detailed changes should check

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.6.3:

[Mitch, our stenographer, will fill this in]

KNOWN BUGS:

While we're not saying Freeciv 1.6.4 is bug-free, we believe it's stable
enough to be considered safe for everyday use.

However if you do find one, please report it (or other problems) to
the Freeciv mailing list.  See:

THINGS TO DO:

 - goto should be looked at, as units with moves left after a goto should
   be active but aren't.

 - There may be some problem with cities being irrigated.
