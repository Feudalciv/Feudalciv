Welcome to Freeciv 2.4
======================

The most important changes between major releases are shown below.
Not all changes are shown here. Those who are interested in seeing
the detailed changes should check the ChangeLog file.


MAJOR CHANGES FROM 2.3.x to 2.4.0
---------------------------------

   (from <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-2.4.0>)

   As is usual for major releases, 2.4 clients cannot interoperate with
   pre-2.4 servers, and vice versa. Pre-2.4 savegames can however be
   loaded into 2.4, and in most cases, the supplied rulesets have not
   changed so much as to make it difficult to complete a game started with
   2.3.x's rules.

Server / General

Gameplay

     * The maximum theoretical map size has increased from 128,000 to
       2,048,000 tiles; the maximum linear map dimension has increased
       from 512 to 32,768. GNA#18087
     * If map generation fails (for instance the common failure to
       allocate start positions), it is now retried with a different
       random seed. GNAPATCH#2402
     * A couple of new server settings have been added to customise
       gameplay:
          + 'revealmap' allows the map to be shown to all players at game
            start, or to dead players. GNAPATCH#2379
          + 'first_timeout' allows the first turn to have a different
            timeout from subsequent turns. GNAPATCH#1967

Clerical

     * Player authentication has been revamped. Database access is now
       mediated by a Lua script that can be customised by server
       operators, and uses Luasql, enabling a variety of backends: MySQL
       (the only backend supported previously), SQLite, and PostgreSQL.
       See doc/README.fcdb for details. GNA#13643
          + Support is included 'out of the box' for SQLite and MySQL
            databases. SQLite uses a simple file as a database, and is
            recommended as being entirely adequate for Freeciv
            authentication and much less hassle to set up than MySQL.
     * The server now supports a 'delegation' feature similar to that in
       Longturn, where one user can nominate another to temporarily take
       over control of the game. This is controlled by the '/delegate'
       server command. GNAPATCH#2121
     * There is a new "map image" feature to save an overview map as an
       image. This is a much expanded version of the previous --Ppm server
       feature, which has been removed. Compared to --Ppm, the new feature
       can distinguish units, cities, borders, terrain colors, hex tiles,
       and more. Saving images can be triggered automatically (turn-based)
       on the server, or on demand on the server or client. See the
       '/mapimg' server command. GNAPATCH#1391
          + A series of these images can be assembled into an animation to
            replay the progress of the game. A shell script 'mapimg2anim'
            is provided to help with this.
     * Player colors are now assigned centrally, and can be changed with
       the '/playercolor' server command. There is a new server setting
       'plrcolormode' that controls how colors are assigned, including a
       mode where all players on a team have the same color. GNAPATCH#2062
          + The set of default player colors in the supplied rulesets has
            been reworked to enhance visibility of borders against
            terrain, etc. GNA#19778
     * The colors used to represent different terrain types on the minimap
       have been reworked. GNAPATCH#2069
     * The 'autosaves' setting gives finer control over when savegames are
       generated. GNAPATCH#2536
          + To disable autosaves entirely, instead of '/set saveturns 0',
            it's now necessary to use a command like '/set autosaves ""'.
     * The scripts 'ser' and 'civ' have been renamed to 'fcser' and
       'fcgui' respectively. GNAPATCH#2830
     * A Lua script can be read from a file with the '/lua file' command.
       Direct Lua input is now via the '/lua cmd' command. GNAPATCH#2338
       GNAPATCH#2869
     * New server option --Bind-meta to control which network interface
       the metaserver connection is made from. GNA#14106
     * The server can be built with support for .xz (LZMA) compression for
       saved games, etc. See the 'compresstype' option. GNAPATCH#1810
     * The freeciv-modpack utility supports more modpack types, more
       options (see --help), and uses the Curl library for network access
       so should be more robust.

Clients

     * There is a new client, freeciv-gtk3, based on version 3 of the Gtk+
       toolkit. This is fully playable and has largely identical UI and
       functionality to freeciv-gtk2. Currently it is experimental;
       however, it is expected that it will become the default client in
       the next major release.
          + The first time you run this client, it will copy any Gtk2
            client settings you have set. Thereafter, Gtk2 and Gtk3
            settings will remain separate.
     * (In the code there is also the start of a Qt client. However, at
       this point it is just a stub and is unlikely to be of interest.
       Development will continue in 2.5.)
     * A server spawned by the client now only listens on the local
       network interface, so clients on other machines cannot connect to
       it. This improves security for single-player games, but means that
       a multiplayer game can no longer be hosted by the client; you must
       start a separate server instead (see the FAQ). GNA#18530
     * It's now possible to display a map overlay indicating which tiles
       the currently selected unit can enter ("native" tiles), with the
       Shift-Ctrl-N keyboard shortcut. GNA#13620
     * The research speed in bulbs per turn is now available with other
       research information from popups/tooltips on the main window.
       GNA#17685 GNA#16481
     * For rulesets where different nations have unique gameplay
       attributes (different initial governments, techs, units, or
       buildings), this information is now available when picking a nation
       in the pregame, and in the online help. GNAPATCH#3066
     * The client now displays the current stable version of Freeciv and
       whether that's newer than the running version (this information
       comes from the metaserver). GNAPATCH#2735
     * (Gtk) The client now has a Lua scripting console. GNAPATCH#2515
          + This is currently something of a proof of concept rather than
            a finished feature, as a comprehensive API suitable for the
            client-side has not been provided. Notably, there are not yet
            any signals from which client-side scripts can be triggered.
          + However, client scripts do have access to the client's view of
            most of the same game data that server-side ruleset scripts do
            (map, units, cities etc); see the Lua reference manual. This
            should be sufficient for some useful work. For example, it
            should in principle be possible to implement an on-demand
            optimal trade route calculator with these facilities (although
            we haven't tried).
     * (Gtk) The unit selection dialog has been revamped to allow browsing
       and selecting units by combinations of location and activity,
       anywhere in the world. GNA#17236
     * (Gtk) A bribe cost is now shown in the popup for units (for enemy
       units, this is estimated). GNA#17489

Tilesets / Art

     * The orientation of units is now tracked, so tilesets can provide
       different graphics for different unit orientations. GNAPATCH#2719
          + A tileset making use of this, Cimpletoon, is included. It is
            based on Amplio2 but has a full set of oriented unit sprites
            for the default ruleset. GNAPATCH#2739
          + Known issue: Cimpletoon does not yet have sprites for all
            Fundamentalist units (it lacks Elephants and Crusaders), so
            for rulesets with these units, it will use fallback sprites
            (Chariot and Knights respectively). GNA#19998

Gameplay / Rules

Changes affecting supplied rulesets

     * Nations:
          + The number of playable nations has increased from 387 to 541.
          + Out of these, a subset of 50 "core" nations has been defined,
            based mostly on nations that have appeared in the Civilization
            series of games. For localised versions of Freeciv, these
            nations are more likely to be translated than the remainder.
            Players are initially presented with the core set, and it will
            be used for random nation selection if no nations are
            specifically selected; but players can still select nations
            outside the core set, and if some do, then the full range of
            supplied nations will be used for random selection of
            remaining players. GNAPATCH#3449 GNAPATCH#3432
          + The civ1 and civ2 rulesets now have their own separate nation
            sets, more closely matching the original games. GNAPATCH#2243
     * The effect of veterancy on the cost of bribing a unit now depends
       on veteran bonuses, not numeric veteran level; bribe costs for
       veteran units have thus changed. GNA#19253
     * When the 'barbarians' server setting is disabled, huts no longer
       spawn barbarians.
     * When migration is enabled, citizens now consider the risk of plague
       when deciding whether to migrate. GNA#17740
     * In rulesets without tech upkeep enabled, if the bulb count goes
       negative (for instance due to 'conquercost'), technologies are no
       longer lost. This restores the behavior of previous versions of
       Freeciv. GNA#19487
     * Diplomats and Spies now have special names for their veteran
       levels, but behaviour is unchanged from 2.3. GNA#19850
     * In the default, multiplayer, and experimental rulesets, years are
       displayed with CE/BCE rather than BC/AD notation. GNA#15090
     * Changes to the 'experimental' ruleset:
          + Citizen nationality is enabled; see below.
          + Workers and Engineers can now gain veteran levels by working
            the land; this in turn allows them to work faster.
            GNAPATCH#2370 GNA#19818
          + A Mech. Inf. unit can now carry up to three Missile units.
            GNAPATCH#2481
          + Galleons can now carry Big Land units, and Frigates no longer
            can. Old savegames are handled gracefully. GNAPATCH#2643
          + Most technologies now have 'root_req' requirements. This means
            that it is not possible to acquire the technology by any means
            unless you already possess its 'root_req'.
            Currently-unreachable requirements are entirely hidden by
            default in the Gtk client, so when the game starts you can
            only see a few techs; you can see the rest with the 'Show all'
            button. GNAPATCH#2381

Changes and new features for rulesets/modpacks/scenarios

     * New feature: optionally, the nationality of citizens can be
       tracked. For instance, when you conquer a city, its citizens retain
       their original nationality. Currently this affects the cost of
       inciting cities and the chance of migration (if enabled); more
       effects are planned for future versions. GNAPATCH#2265
     * The veteran system has been reworked:
          + Per-unit veteran levels have been generalised; all veteran
            properties can now be set on a per-unit basis; previously, the
            chances of moving between levels could not. This means that
            different units can now usefully have different numbers of
            veteran levels for the first time. GNAPATCH#2346
          + Diplomatic combat and spy mission survival chances are now
            derived directly from the 'power_fact' property of the veteran
            level, rather than being based purely on the numeric veteran
            level. GNA#19850
          + As noted above, the effect of veterancy on unit bribe costs
            has changed.
          + The maximum number of veteran levels has doubled from 10 to
            20.
          + Units with only a single veteran level, or which can't become
            veteran, now do not have a veteran level displayed.
          + Information about veteran levels is now included in the
            on-line help. GNA#19851
     * Recursive transports are now supported (up to a depth of 5).
       GNAPATCH#2270
     * Two new tech_cost_styles: 3 with a new formula (early techs
       slightly easier, later techs much harder), and 4 which is similar
       to 2 (read from ruleset) but with the gaps filled with the new
       formula. GNAPATCH#2396
     * A new effect 'Irrig_Possible' and requirement range 'CAdjacent'
       (cardinally adjacent) have been added. The requirement for oceans
       or rivers for irrigation is thus no longer hardcoded and can be
       modified. GNAPATCH#2450
     * The 'CityTile' requirement now supports 'Adjacent' and 'CAdjacent'
       ranges, so effects can be triggered for tiles next to a city.
       GNA#18551
     * 'Surviving' requirements for wonders are now supported at Player
       range as well as at World range. GNA#17463
     * In ruleset definitions, specifying 'move_type' for a unit is now
       optional; if not specified it will be inferred from the native
       terrains/specials of the unit. GNA#13630 GNAPATCH#2991
     * A ruleset can now specify a 'default_government' for all its
       nations in nations.ruleset, rather than each nation being required
       to specify its initial government individually. GNAPATCH#3031
          + The supplied nations no longer include
            init_government="Despotism", so they can be used in rulesets
            which require a different initial government. GNAPATCH#3032
     * The image used for a city in the client is now set by the effects
       system (effect 'City_Image'), so it's no longer constrained to be a
       simple function of city size. GNA#17110
          + The experimental ruleset uses this to align city graphics with
            the city map radius.
     * Tile labels are supported. These are text labels that are displayed
       by all clients when they display a particular map tile. They can be
       added to scenarios in the editor. GNAPATCH#2408
     * The colors used for players, and for terrains on the minimap and
       map images, are now specified by the ruleset on the server side,
       rather than the tileset on the client side. GNAPATCH#2060
       GNAPATCH#2061
     * In rulesets with tech_leakage enabled, dead players are no longer
       taken into account in the calculation; so you cannot gain from
       their knowledge, but equally a dead, ignorant player no longer
       pushes up research costs. GNAPATCH#2956
     * The behavior where the senate of representative governments is
       bypassed has moved from the Any_Government to the No_Anarchy
       effect. GNA#19107
     * Many changes to ruleset Lua scripting -- for full details see the
       Lua reference manual. These are all backward compatible.
       Highlights:
          + Script-triggered climate change (GNAPATCH#2624) and civil war
            (GNAPATCH#2627).
          + Scripts can now move existing units.
          + A script can test whether tiles have a particular base.
            GNAPATCH#2672
          + Script facilities for reading and manipulating unit
            orientation. GNAPATCH#2823 GNAPATCH#2836
          + Scripts can now read server settings. GNAPATCH#2955

   (See also How to update a ruleset from 2.3 to 2.4.)

AI

     * The AI's management of its tax rates has been reworked to be more
       sophisticated; notably, it now takes tech upkeep into account. It
       also considers tech upkeep when determining the value of a tech.
       GNAPATCH#2251
     * AI planning for new cities has been improved slightly. GNA#19449
     * Autosettler planning for building railroads (GNAPATCH#2885,
       GNA#19560) and farmland (GNAPATCH#2889) has been improved. (Note
       that the latter is still only triggered by the existence of a
       Supermarket, so the AI still does not benefit, due to a
       chicken-and-egg situation.)
     * The extensive reworking of the AI code (see #Development), while
       not intended to introduce any functional changes, is likely to have
       done so anyway.

Translations

     * New Indonesian translation.
     * Updated translations: Bulgarian, Catalan, Spanish, Scottish Gaelic,
       Korean, Polish, Dutch, Irish, and French.

Development

     * The AI code has been heavily refactored, with a view to making it
       easier for people to start their own projects to write better
       Freeciv AI.
          + There's now a concept of AI type; different players can have
            different AIs. The type can be specified to the server /create
            command and the Lua function edit.create_player().
          + The server can be built to accept dynamically loadable AI
            modules with the --enable-aimodules option to configure. A
            module is loaded by starting the server with the --LoadAI
            option.
          + Alternatively, a fixed set of modules can be compiled in with
            --enable-ai-static.
          + In addition to the 'classic' AI, the standard Freeciv package
            ships with the 'stub' and 'threaded' AIs. These are both dummy
            templates for development and do not work as shipped. They are
            enabled with the configure option
            --enable-aimodules=experimental.
          + See doc/README.packaging for some more information.

Build/portability

     * There is now a hard dependency on libcurl for HTTP access. This is
       used for metaserver communication and for freeciv-modpack.
       GNAPATCH#2320 GNAPATCH#2376
     * Efforts have been made to make the codebase compile without
       warnings with GCC 4.6.
     * Use of some GNU make extensions has been removed from the build
       system, so it may now be possible to build with a POSIX 'make'.
       GNAPATCH#3378
     * freeciv-modpack can be built against either gtk2 or gtk3.
       GNAPATCH#2762
     * The configure option --enable-sys-lua allows use of a system-wide
       copy of Lua instead of the one shipped with Freeciv. GNAPATCH#2747

   See doc/README.packaging for more information.


MAJOR CHANGES FROM 2.2.x to 2.3.0
---------------------------------

   (from <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-2.3.0>)

   As well as many new features, many features from Longturn and some from
   Warclient have been merged into the main codebase for this release.

   A new program has been added to the Freeciv suite: 'freeciv-modpack'.
   This makes it easier to download and install add-ons ('modpacks':
   rulesets, tilesets, etc) to the right place; you can enter a URL,
   choose an add-on from the list, and the tool will install it to the
   correct place for this version of Freeciv to use it. Modpack authors
   should see this page for details of how to publish modpacks for
   installation by this program. GNAPATCH#1822

   As is usual for major releases, 2.3 clients cannot interoperate with
   pre-2.3 servers, and vice versa. Pre-2.3 savegames can however be
   loaded into 2.3, and in most cases, the supplied rulesets have not
   changed so much as to make it difficult to complete a game started with
   2.2.x's rules.

Server / General

Gameplay

     * Various limits have been lifted, including:
          + Maximum number of simultaneous players increased from 30 to
            126 GNAPATCH#1731
          + Map size
               o Maximum map size increased from 30,000 to 128,000 tiles;
                 maximum linear map dimensions increased from 254 to 512
                 GNAPATCH#1733
               o Minimum map size reduced to 16x16(!) GNA#17031
          + Allow goto paths that take more than 99 turns GNA#16792
     * There are now more ways of specifying the map size. Instead of
       specifying the size in thousands of tiles (via the 'size' option),
       you can specify the number of tiles per player ('tilesperplayer'),
       or the exact X and Y sizes ('xsize' and 'ysize'). The method is
       selected with the 'mapsize' option. GNAPATCH#1720
     * A number of new server settings have been added to customise
       gameplay:
          + 'killunhomed': units without a home city (such as starting
            units) can be configured to lose hitpoints each turn until
            they die. GNAPATCH#1501
          + 'unreachableprotects' controls whether 'unreachable' units
            (such as Bombers) protect the whole stack on their tile as in
            previous versions. If this is unset, a mixed stack is
            vulnerable to attack (including normally-unreachable units).
            GNAPATCH#1850
          + 'unitwaittime' allows a minimum time to be enforced between
            actions of a given unit on successive turns, to mitigate the
            'double-move problem'. GNAPATCH#1500
          + 'restrictinfra' allows enemy use of infrastructure such as
            roads and rails to be restricted. GNAPATCH#1266
          + 'airliftingstyle' allows airlifts between allied cities, and
            unlimited airlifts per turn. GNAPATCH#1189
          + 'techlost_recv'/'techlost_donor' allow introduction of a risk
            of technology loss when technologies are transferred between
            civilizations (via diplomacy, espionage, conquest etc).
            GNAPATCH#1263
          + 'trading_tech'/'trading_gold'/'trading_city' allow certain
            types of diplomatic agreements to be selectively disabled.
            GNAPATCH#1504, GNAPATCH#1506
          + 'globalwarming'/'nuclearwinter' allow these global
            catastrophes to be disabled. GNAPATCH#1505
          + 'team_pooled_research' allows pooled research to be disabled.
            GNAPATCH#1868
          + 'alliedvictory': all players in an alliance can share victory.
            This new behaviour is enabled by default. GNA#14278
     * (as of rc1) Changes to the 'timeout' setting now always have
       immediate effect, as in 2.0.x; previously, changes between non-zero
       values would not take effect until the next turn. GNA#18079
     * Improvements to observing:
          + The demographic report is now available to global observers.
            GNA#16486
          + Global observers can now view the city report (it shows cities
            from all nations). GNA#16699 GNAPATCH#2571
          + Global observers can now access the buildable target list in
            the city dialog. GNA#16487
     * The number of units built, killed, etc now contributes to the final
       score, and appears in the endgame report. GNAPATCH#1870
     * Changing a unit's activity is now more forgiving: if you
       accidentally stop an activity such as irrigation, but restart it
       without doing anything else, progress is no longer lost. GNA#15510

Clerical

     * Settings configuration on the client and server has been reworked.
       The most notable change is that enumerated and bitwise options are
       now set with strings instead of numbers (for instance, '/set
       barbarians hordes' instead of 4, '/set topology wrapx|wrapy'
       instead of 3). GNAPATCH#1301
     * The FREECIV_PATH environment variable can be overridden by three
       new variables: FREECIV_DATA_PATH, FREECIV_SAVE_PATH, and
       FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH. GNA#14624
     * Add-ons are now loaded from a sub-path ~/.freeciv/<version>/ (e.g.,
       ~/.freeciv/2.3/), since they tend to be specific to a version of
       Freeciv. GNA#14624
     * Servers send more information to the metaserver:
          + The 'timeout' and 'aifill' options (GNAPATCH#2092);
          + (as of beta2) the number of human players (as opposed to AIs)
            (GNAPATCH#2312); as of beta3 this is displayed in the client
            (GNAPATCH#2411)
     * New server command '/kick' and associated option 'kicktime' to lock
       out troublesome users. GNA#16933
     * New server commands '/ignore', '/unignore', and '/list ignored
       users', allowing players to suppress chat messages from specific
       users. GNAPATCH#1910
     * The '/create' command can now create a new player even in a running
       game. GNAPATCH#1574
     * New command '/lua' to execute a line of Lua script on the server
       command line. GNA#15644
     * More options have been added to the '/reset' command. GNAPATCH#1284
     * The name of the scorelog file is configurable with the new
       'scorefile' option. GNAPATCH#1750
     * The current ruleset can be shown by '/show rulesetdir' instead of
       '/rulesetdir' (this allows less privileged users to do so).
       GNA#16636
     * Observers can see the current votes in progress with the new
       command '/list votes'. GNA#16635
     * The server uses a new format for savegames. It can load savegames
       generated by old versions of Freeciv, but old versions will not be
       able to load new savegames. GNAPATCH#1541
          + Support has been added for future versions of Freeciv to save
            backward-compatible savegames (back to 2.3.0) via the
            'saveversion' server option.

Clients

     * Various report screens have been reworked so as not to redraw and
       lose their selections after a few seconds. GNA#16439
     * The total revenue from trade routes is now visible in the city
       report. GNA#16812
     * The chat log file name is now configurable. GNAPATCH#1749
     * (GTK) Some rework of the pregame connection screen and menus
       (GNA#16685). Buttons on this screen now adapt to selected
       player/user (GNA#15300).
     * (GTK) Tab completion of user and player names on the chatline.
       GNAPATCH#1867
     * (GTK) The goto/airlift dialog now shows which nation each city
       belongs to, and more detail on airlift capacity. GNA#15313
       GNAPATCH#2588
     * The research report is now updated when tax rates or city science
       output change. GNA#16776
     * (as of beta2) Improve handling of (non-default) rulesets which
       restrict reachability of technologies (via root_req in the ruleset)
       in the science report. You can now choose whether unreachable
       technologies are displayed. GNA#16852, GNA#16855, etc
     * (as of beta2) (Xaw) The Take Player command is implemented.
       GNAPATCH#2253
     * (as of rc1) In 2.2.x, the "Sell Obsolete" button in the Economy
       report could never be pressed. It has been renamed to "Sell
       Redundant", and now lets 'redundant' buildings be sold en masse
       (redundant buildings are those whose effects are entirely
       superseded by another, for which you may still be paying upkeep --
       for instance, Power Plants are redundant in cities with a
       Hydro/Nuclear/Solar Plants). In the Gtk client, the "Obsolete"
       column in the Economy report has been replaced with a "Redundant"
       column showing how many of each building in your empire are
       redundant. GNA#17937

Gameplay / Rules

Changes affecting supplied rulesets

     * Two new rulesets are included in the distribution:
          + multiplayer: a ruleset based on the default but tuned for
            multiplayer games, based on Madeline Book's "rewonder" ruleset
            for 2.1.
          + experimental: a ruleset showcasing new features of the Freeciv
            "engine", without strict regard for game balance and
            playability. It enables some of the new features mentioned
            below, such as variable city radii.
     * More than doubled the number of playable nations (from 187 to 387).
       Many improvements to existing nations, such as using native
       spellings for cities and leaders.
     * The interaction of promotions and diplomat-vs-diplomat contests has
       changed:
          + Attacking diplomats can now gain experience; previously, only
            defending diplomats gained experience. GNA#17265
          + The effect of veterancy on the outcome of these contests has
            been reduced; it can change the odds by at most 20%
            (previously, elite diplomats could become practically
            invincible). GNA#17264
     * The terrain effects of global warming and nuclear winter are now
       more severe: land can be lost to ocean (and vice versa), and
       glaciers can melt. GNA#17105
     * If migration occurs, citizens take half the food in the granary
       with them. GNAPATCH#1232
     * (as of rc1) In rulesets with Fundamentalism, it now has a happiness
       penalty for empire size (as it did in 2.0.x). GNA#18133
     * (as of rc2) The civ2 ruleset now uses a restricted set of 25
       nations, to better resemble the original game. Loading civ2
       savegames from older versions of Freeciv may cause nations to be
       reassigned; it will not be possible to load a civ2 savegame with
       more than 23 (non-barbarian) players. GNA#18419

New features for ruleset/modpack/scenario authors

   These features have been added to the Freeciv "engine", but aren't
   enabled in standard rulesets (except the experimental ruleset, in some
   cases).
     * Variable city radius: the circle of tiles able to be worked by a
       city is no longer fixed but can vary (radii from 1 to 5 possible)
       depending on requirements defined by the ruleset. GNAPATCH#1235
          + Accordingly, the maximum value for the 'citymindist' server
            option has been increased from 5 to 9. GNAPATCH#2262
     * Build slots: in ruleset-defined circumstances, cities with large
       production surpluses can now produce more than one of a given type
       of unit per turn. GNAPATCH#1234
     * Tech upkeep: rulesets can cause some research output to be diverted
       to maintaining expertise in existing technology rather than
       discovering new technology, with the risk of losing advances if the
       upkeep is not met (similar to gold upkeep for city improvements).
       GNAPATCH#1264
     * Rulesets can define units that can be converted into another type
       of unit on the player's command. GNA#13890
     * Rulesets can define "Capturable" units that can be captured by
       certain other "Capturer" units. (There is an associated server
       option 'homecaughtunits'.) GNAPATCH#1851
     * Rulesets can suggest or mandate server settings. GNA#13873,
       GNAPATCH#1200
     * A start position in a scenario can now be restricted to a set of
       nations rather than a single nation. The built-in editor now
       supports editing this set. GNA#13803
     * Various improvements to Lua scripting. See Events Reference Manual
       for some more detail.

Tilesets / Art

     * New default tileset with redrawn terrain graphics: "Amplio 2". The
       original Amplio tileset is available for 2.3 as an add-on (it can
       be found with the freeciv-modpack utility). GNAPATCH#1777
     * Larger versions of flags and shields are now included in the
       Freeciv distribution for use by larger tilesets; they are used in
       Amplio2 (as of beta4). GNAPATCH#2202

Translations

     * (as of rc2) New Scottish Gaelic localization (complete).
     * (as of beta3) New Irish Gaelic localization (not yet complete:
       55%).
     * Updated translations:
          + Complete translations: Polish, French, Spanish, Catalan, and
            British English.
          + Incomplete translations: Danish (95.8%), Finnish (85%),
            Ukrainian (81%), Italian (74%), Japanese (70%), Brazilian
            Portuguese (70%), Russian (69%), Swedish (60%), Lithuanian
            (43%), and Simplified Chinese (40%).

KNOWN ISSUES

     * There are some regressions in the SDL client relative to 2.2.x:
          + The city dialog has not been redesigned to accommodate the
            larger city map required by variable city radius support. As a
            result, the city map display is scaled down and difficult to
            read. GNA#15804
          + Not all setting types can now be modified; bitwise and color
            settings are not yet supported. GNAPATCH#1631 GNAPATCH#1957

          + Triremes are not restricted to tiles next to land, but to
            (shallow) Ocean tiles; they now cannot even attempt to enter
            unsafe tiles
          + Triremes no longer get the +1 movement bonus from Nuclear
            Power that other sea units get
          + Triremes and Carriers can no longer attack land units

   have Seafaring or 4 when you reach Navigation (previously only fixed
   at 50% before being divided).
 - Glacier terrain is now unsafe for land units (15% chance per turn of
   being lost). Also doesn't count as coastline for Trireme safety or Fish
   and Whale generation. Roads/railroads can be built but all units (worker
   too) get 15% chance per turn of being lost any way!

   maps.
 - You can load savegames from the server prompt.
 - You can save client commandline defaults.
 - Specialists are taken from content citizens first, instead of from
   unhappy citizens first. This makes it more difficult to quell unrest
   using taxmen and scientists.
 - You now start with no technologies by default, and angry citizens 
   are enabled by default, although they will rarely make an apperance.
 - The algorithm used for calculating the effects of tax settings has
   been changed. It is now no longer possible to get 100% effect from 
   60% choice of tax goal.
 - A new, historically more correct version of the rulesets included.
 - There is an option to require several turns of rapture/celebration 
   before it takes effect. See "show rapturedelay" in server.
 - The sequence of some end of turn activities have been regrouped.
 - Several AI improvements. It should now build and buy units and 
   buildings slightly more intelligently.

 - A truly massive amount of bugfixes.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.12.0

 - Citizen Management Agent (CMA) allows you to automate workers
   and specialists in cities.
 - Sound support has been added.
 - The new "isotrident" tileset has been made the default. The
   "hires" and "engels" tilesets have been taken out of the
   distribution but can be downloaded from the web page.
 - New city dialog in the gtk client.
 - Windows version of the client. It has improved connection
   dialog and supports loading and saving from the client.
 - GTK 2.0 version of the client.
 - The client will try to suggest names for your cities that 
   correspond with what they mean.
 - Improved players dialog shows sortable and colored information,
   including the players' flags.
 - Server no longer takes the --server command line option,
   instead you can use the --info option to set the metaserver
   announcement text to whatever you like. The -a option when given
   to the client skips the connection dialog entirely.
 - A "wall" server command added which gives message to all players.
 - A new flexible timeout set through "timeoutinc" server option.
 - Leftover research bulbs will carry over to next advance.
 - Trade routes are more effective.
 - Units attacking ships in cities double their firepower, while 
   defenders get only 1 firepower.
 - Helicopters defending against air units get 50% penalty, and
   have their firepower reduced to 1 against fighter units.
 - You can build city walls even though you have Great Wall wonder.
 - The Communism government's food cost in default ruleset has
   been changed to 1, while it has been changed to 2 for the Civ2
   ruleset.

   partially invisible just like subs. Also, stealth bombers have
   increased their attack strength from 14 to 18.
 - Civ2 ruleset now has Fundamentalism.
 - Improved modpack abilities: The caravan ability has been split.
   New ways to calculate technology costs. Better documentation.
   Rulesets can specify starting techs. You can have more than one
   bonus tech. Split settler abilities. Buildings ruleset syntax
   has been significantly extended, but effects do not work yet.
 - Server option "tinyisles" allow 1x1 size islands and 
   "separatepoles" allow continents connected to the poles
 - "citymindist" specify minimum distance between cities, while 
   "notradesize" and "fulltradesize" regulate the trade generated 
   by smaller cities.
 - You can turn on angry citizens with "angrycitizens" option.
 - Fortresses may give you extended vision. See watchtower options.
 - If you lose your palace, you get a new one for free in a 
   randomly chosen city. This behaviour can be turned off with the
   server option "savepalace".
 - Rulesets are now loaded from inside the server through the
   "rulesetdir" command.
 - The limit on the number of nations that can be included with 
   Freeciv has been removed.
 - The format of the isometric tileset spec-files has changed.
 - The map and ai code has been cleaned up significantly.
 - Translations improved. Added better support for plural forms.
 - Several bugs squished and a lot of work done under the hood.
 - For an overview of the remaining bugs please visit doc/BUGS.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.11.4

 - Internationalization extended.  Still needs improvement.
   Current localizations: de en_GB es fr hu it ja nl no pl pt pt_BR
   ro ru sv.
 - Isometric view in gtk and amiga clients using the mostly civ2-
   compatible HiRes tileset. This is on by default, but the old non-
   isometric tiles are still available by giving a --tiles argument to
   the client, fx "civclient --tiles trident".
 - While planning a goto (after hitting "g") a line will be displayed
   showing the route from the selected unit to the mouse pointer.
   Hitting "g" will insert a waypoint at the mouse pointer.
 - The server now has readline completion. This works at all levels,
   fx "cu<TAB>" completes to "cut", and if there exist a player named

   also lost.
 - diplomats/spies can't take action from a ship.
 - Refueling air units at turn update will refuel units with only 1 fuel
   first. Secundary criteria is unit cost.
 - Trireme loss percentage depends upon known technologies.

 - Lots of bug fixes, code cleanups, and help-text improvements.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.8.1:

 - Internationalization added.  Some aspects still need improvement,
   and in particular currently only works well if client and server
   both use the same language.  Initial (partial) translations
   included are: de es fr hu pl pt pt_BR.
 - Improvements to "trident" tileset, and this set is now the default.
 - New ruleset support for NATIONS, and many new nations added --
   there are now 32 nations in the default nations file.  Also allow
   multiple leaders choices for each nation, allow longer player
   names, and allow specifying/choosing sex of leader.

   technology dependent styles, but lacking good graphics except for
   the default style.  Cities show a small flag when occupied by one
   or more units.
 - From Civ2, added Paratroopers unit and Airbase infrastructure.
 - Initial window size of Gtk+ client is smaller, to fit better on
   smaller screens, and can now resize detached chat/output window.
 - City report enhancements: New "Change All" dialog to convert all
   production of a given item to some other item (both clients); can
   select multiple cities and issue commands (Gtk+ client only); can
   sort by different columns (Gtk+ client only).  Can also select
   multiple items in the Trade Report (Gtk+ client only).
 - In Civ2 style, can select which infrastructure item to pillage, and
   multiple units can pillage together.  Can now pillage fortresses,
   as well as new farmland and airbase infrastructure items.
 - More fields added to Demographics Report, and now configurable from
   a server option.
 - Added more information to "Active Units Report", and renamed to
   "Military Report".

   cancels Go-To/Paradrop/nuke mode; pollution on city squares is now
   always clearly visible; improvements to refresh method for pixmaps
   in Gtk+ client; various other improvements to both clients.
 - Autosettlers no longer convert Plains/Grasslands to Forests, but
   will now Transform terrain.
 - AI can build spaceships, although does not do so very aggressively
   or intelligently yet.
 - Server and client may specify a different metaserver to use.  There
   is now a metaserver running on www.freeciv.org, and that is now the
   default metaserver (http://www.freeciv.org/metaserver).
 - New server option for "turn blocking" mode, in which players will
   never miss a turn even if sometimes disconnected.

   variable number of items in each (up to 200) and no longer any
   techs with hardwired effects depending on position in ruleset file.
 - Appropriate helptext now appears in ruleset files, allowing
   modpacks to give modified help to correspond to modified items.
 - Format of ruleset files is changed, no longer compatible with
   those for 1.8.0 and 1.8.1.
 - Removed science bonus of +1 per city per turn.
 - In Civ2 mode, overflight of a hut causes it to disappear, and can't
   build cities next to each other.
 - Rapture_size now 3, to conform to Civ2.
 - Settlers and Engineers now cost shield upkeep as well as food
   upkeep (depending on government type) as in both Civ1 and Civ2.
 - Helicopters do not lose hitpoints when over an airbase.
 - The amount of food required for a city grow is now ((citysize+1) *
   foodbox), instead of (citysize * foodbox); new behavior matches
   both Civ1 and Civ2.
 - Some re-organization of data directory, in adding data/scenario,
   and graphics now in data/trident, data/engels and data/misc.
 - Preliminary support for compiling the server on Mac (but networking
   code not yet ported).

 - Lots of bug fixes, code cleanups, and help-text improvements.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.8.0:

 - The biggest change is a new client which uses the popular Gtk+
   toolkit.  The old Xaw client is still included as well.
 - A new alternate (30x30) tileset: the "trident" tileset.
   Start the client with "--tiles trident" to try it out.
   (This replaces the "classic/brunus" tileset, which is still
   available separately from the Freeciv ftp site.)
 - In the Gtk+ client, parts of the main window can be detached.
   Detaching them all allows a full-screen map window!
 - The data directory can now be specified as a "path" ($FREECIV_PATH),
   instead of a single directory.  By default, ~/.freeciv is now in
   the path, so if you download new tiles, modpacks, etc, you can now
   simply put them in ~/.freeciv
 - Server console improvements: can abbreviate server command names,
   and server option names.  Better prompt handling - eg, server no
   longer prints an unnecessary prompt each turn.

   There is a new server command "cmdlevel", to control access to
   this feature on a per-player basis.

 - Minor "Zone of Control" (ZOC) rules changes to better match Civ2.
 - Improved debug logging.
 - Server will refuse to run as root, as a security measure.
 - As always: lots of bug fixes, code cleanups, and help-text
   improvements.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.7.2:

 - Space race!  Be the first player to build a space ship and colonize
   Alpha Centauri.
 - Civil war!  Capturing the enemy capital may split his empire.  Half
   of his towns will join a new AI leader!
 - Two tile sets in this release! The "big" ones are from Ralph Engels.
   I hope you will enjoy them.  The second set is an enhancement of the
   classic ones.  The server option -tiles allows to choose a subdirectory
   of the data directory to use different tiles.  (The data directory can
   be set with the DATADIR environment variable.)  Also, diagonal roads
   and railroads are now drawn.  Changed some of the national flags
   (especially changed Soviet flag to the Russian flag for Russians).
 - Rulesets can be used to customise units, advances, wonders, and
   improvements without recompiling -- see README.rulesets.
 - Units in a town can be put in auto-attack mode.  In this mode, they
   will attack any enemy units which come nearby.
 - New city options for each city, controlling whether new citizens are
   workers or specialists, whether to allow disbanding a size 1 city by
   building a settler, and options for units on auto-attack mode in the
   city.
 - Mapgen 4 (selected with the server command "set generator 4") is a new
   map generator which generates a map with 2 players on each island.
 - Cities can be a traded in diplomatic treaties.  This effectively
   allows you to exchange, sell or buy cities.
 - The AI now builds diplomats to defend against enemy diplomats.
 - Settlers and engineers can do teamwork.  With enough manpower, all
   terrain improvements can be done fast!
 - With engineers, the terrain type can be changed using the new Transform
   command ('O').  For example, hills can be turned into plains.
 - Units only regenerate hit points if they have not moved at all for a
   full turn.
 - Gamelog option.  The whole history of a game can be stored in the
   gamelog file.
 - One can select a unit with 0 moves left from the main map.
 - City workers can be adjusted from the main map, with shift+button1.
 - Changed the order of libraries to fix problems on IRIX and Cygwin.
 - Changed the client-server protocol to use network byte order.

 - Clearer Yes/No toggle buttons in various places in the client.
 - Reduced color usage (but looks almost identical), so the client should
   now work fine on systems with 8 bit color displays.
 - Ability to use "scenarios", that is, pre-designed maps.  Scenarios
   for Earth and Europe games are included in the data directory.
   (Use them with the server command-line option -f, like savegames.)
 - More city names, so you're less likely to see "City 41" etc.
 - Saving large games is now much faster, and the savefile is smaller.
 - Improvements to the documentation and online help system, including
   a new help section on the "Zones of Control" game concept.
 - Detect repeated log messages and print repeat counts.
 - New server options randseed and aqueductloss.
 - Many other enhancements and bug fixes.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.7.0:

   Also, they can modified by clicking on the rate status icons.
 - The behaviour of spies and diplomats has been greatly improved.

 - From now on, it will be possible for different Freeciv versions to
   talk to each other if they're able.
 - Tracy Reed (who provides www.freeciv.org) reports that our site is
   getting over 6,000 hits per month.  He was quoted as saying "Cool!
   Now my computer is doing something!"
 - Lots, and Lots, and Lots of donated patches. Thanks guys, keep 'em
   coming!
