Welcome to Freeciv 2.5
======================

The most important changes between major releases are shown below.
Not all changes are shown here. Those who are interested in seeing
the detailed changes should check the ChangeLog file.


MAJOR CHANGES FROM 2.4.x to 2.5.0
---------------------------------

   (from <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-2.5.0>)

   The main changes in Freeciv 2.5 are the inclusion of the 'civ2civ3'
   ruleset, a new Qt client, and much more flexibility for those creating
   their own rulesets. The AI has also had some improvements.

   As is usual for major releases, 2.5 clients cannot interoperate with
   pre-2.5 servers, and vice versa. Pre-2.5 savegames can however be
   loaded into 2.5, and in most cases, the supplied rulesets have not
   changed so much as to make it difficult to complete a game started with
   2.4.x's rules.

Server / General

Changes affecting players (supplied rulesets)

   A new ruleset civ2civ3 is included, an evolution of the civ2_3 ruleset
   by David Fernandez (bardo). This has some elements from Civ3, and is
   also designed to reduce the gap between inexperienced and optimal play,
   and for the AI to play well. It is suitable for single-player and
   multiplayer games. See doc/README.ruleset_civ2civ3 for more
   information. GNAPATCH#3366
     * This version of the ruleset is similar to previous versions
       available as modpacks, but does have some changes, including taking
       advantage of new facilities in the game engine. civ2civ3 or civ2_3
       games started in previous versions of Freeciv cannot be continued
       with this version.
     * civ2civ3 is planned to become the default ruleset in a future
       release. The current default ruleset has been renamed to 'classic'
       and will continue to be available. From now on the name 'default'
       will refer to whatever ruleset the running version of Freeciv
       defaults to. GNAPATCH#3216

   Rules changes affecting all or most rulesets:
     * (not civ1/civ2) City tiles are no longer an exception to the rule
       that the 'Bridge Building' technology is required to build roads
       over rivers. Cities on river tiles no longer automatically get
       roads until the technology is acquired. GNAPATCH#3007
     * (not civ2/multiplayer) Cities suffer random disasters such as loss
       of population or buildings. A new server setting 'disasters'
       controls their frequency, or disables them entirely.
     * (not civ1/civ2) 'Barracks' buildings and 'Sun Tzu's War Academy'
       are now cumulative: if you have both, new units are created at the
       Hardened veteran level. GNAPATCH#3062
     * Bombarder units (such as bombers and helicopters in civ2civ3) no
       longer gain veterancy from bombardment. GNAPATCH#5835
     * The maximum number of trade routes per city is now
       ruleset-dependent. In the classic and (of as RC1) experimental
       rulesets, the limit on trade routes now depends on what technology
       you have. You start with 2 per city, and can add one more with each
       of 'Magnetism' and 'The Corporation'.
     * In rulesets with nationality tracking (classic, experimental,
       civ2civ3):
          + Citizens now gradually convert to the nationality of the city
            owner over time, at a ruleset-defined rate. GNAPATCH#2365
          + Units now have their own nationality, which remains the same
            even if they are bribed or captured. Settler units add
            citizens of their own nationality when founding or adding to
            cities. GNAPATCH#3625 GNAPATCH#3635
     * Changes to what happens if research points go negative (due to
       transfer costs or tech upkeep):
          + A new server setting 'techlossforgiveness' controls whether
            technologies can be lost at all, and if so, how much debt
            triggers tech loss. Previously this was controlled by the
            ruleset; of the supplied rulesets, only the experimental
            ruleset had this behavior. GNAPATCH#3193
          + When technology is lost, half the bulb cost of the lost
            technology is now added on to the current bulb balance (this
            may not be sufficient to make it positive). The proportion is
            controlled by the new server setting 'techlossrestore'. The
            old behavior, where any bulb debt was completely cancelled,
            can be restored by setting this to -1. GNA#21623
     * A tile with both a river and a fortress now has a lower defensive
       bonus, as the bonuses are now added rather than multiplied.
     * When a freshwater terrain (lake) and an oceanic terrain type become
       adjacent due to terrain change, the ocean now floods the whole
       lake. GNAPATCH#3478 In rulesets with lakes, transforming a swamp
       bordering a lake now results in lake, not ocean. GNA#20043
     * In games where 'startunits' includes a k)ing unit, such units are
       also given to new players created as a result of civil war.
       GNAPATCH#3812

   Rule changes to specific rulesets:
     * classic:
          + Tracking of citizen nationality is now enabled. See the help
            for what this means. GNAPATCH#3624
     * experimental:
          + New road type 'Maglev', requiring 'Superconductors' and giving
            unlimited movement to 'Land' units. Regular railroads now give
            fast but limited movement (each tile takes 1/9 of a movement
            point). GNAPATCH#3295 GNAPATCH#4008
          + Citizens of your enemies in your own cities cause unhappiness,
            with the amount depending on your government type.
            GNAPATCH#3628
          + Partisan appearance now depends on how many of the conquered
            city's citizens had the nationality of the defeated player,
            rather than the original city owner. GNAPATCH#3762
          + Paratroopers can now paradrop directly to a transport in the
            ocean. GNAPATCH#3805
          + (as of RC1) Caravans are no longer obsoleted by Freight, since
            they can travel on more terrain. GNAPATCH#5791
          + Most technologies now have 'root_req' requirements, preventing
            acquisition of the technology by any means (such as trading)
            unless some key earlier technology is known.
          + By default, it is possible to sustain a small research point
            debt without losing a technology. However, if a technology is
            lost, the debt may not be completely cancelled.
     * civ1 and civ2 (to improve their fidelity):
          + Maximum number of trade routes per city reduced from 4 to 3.
          + When a free tech is granted, it's now chosen randomly, rather
            than being whatever the player was researching.

   New game options:
     * 'killstack', which controls whether all units on a tile die
       simultaneously, is now a server setting (previously it was
       controlled by the ruleset). GNA#18698
     * 'killcitizen' is now a boolean setting rather than a bitfield;
       exactly which units can reduce city population is now controlled by
       the ruleset. GNAPATCH#3613
     * Two new values for the 'diplomacy' setting: "NOAI" which allows
       diplomacy except between AIs, and "NOMIXED" which only prevents
       human/AI diplomacy. GNAPATCH#4213
     * A new setting 'startcity' causes players to start with their first
       city already founded. GNAPATCH#3495
     * (as of beta2) New map generation features ported from warserver: a
       'fair' island map generator ('generator=fair'), which creates an
       identical island for each player or team, and 'teamplacement',
       allowing control of whether team-mates start near each other on the
       map. GNAPATCH#5146 GNAPATCH#5145

   Other changes:
     * Nations:
          + Added 16 new playable nations to standard rulesets, bringing
            the total to 555.
          + The set of 50 'core' nations introduced in 2.4 are now by
            default the only nations that will appear in games. To play
            with the full ('extended') set of nations (which might not be
            translated into your language), change the nation set in the
            'pick nation' dialog, or with the server 'nationset' option.
            GNAPATCH#3448
          + The pirate and barbarian flags be swapped, so that pirates now
            have the Jolly Roger, as they should. GNA#22236
     * In the classic and civ2civ3 rulesets, maps are now generated with
       scenic tile labels on a few random tiles. These have no effect on
       gameplay. GNAPATCH#3147
     * Minor changes to transport units:
          + Units may now load onto and unload from transports that are
            themselves inside another transport. GNA#22050 GNA#22190
          + While there is still no way to choose which transport is used
            if there are several on a tile, cargo units will now prefer
            the transport with more move points. GNA#22189
     * Goto / pathfinding:
          + You can now set waypoints for groups of units starting on
            different tiles. GNAPATCH#4418
          + Improved route planning across 'pontoon bridges' (units
            bridging water). GNA#21871
          + Multiple units working on overlapping connect-with-road or
            similar projects no longer interrupt each other's work.
            GNAPATCH#2206

Changes affecting other rulesets / modders

   Ruleset authors can control much more of the game behavior. Existing
   rulesets need changes to work with 2.5; see
   <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/How_to_update_a_ruleset_from_2.4_to_2.5>
   for a minimal recipe, and comments in supplied ruleset files for
   documentation and usage examples of new features.
     * Movement
          + Rulesets can now define new types of paths, replacing
            hard-coded road, railroad, and river behavior. Up to 8
            distinct road and/or river types can be defined. Many
            previously hardcoded behaviors are now configurable.
            GNAPATCH#2521
          + Granularity of movement points ('move_fragments') is now
            specified by the ruleset, rather than being hardcoded at 1/3.
            Move rate of 'IgTer' units is also configurable. GNAPATCH#3990
          + The 'Relaxed' orthogonal move mode for rivers (now also
            available for roads) no longer gives a movement bonus for
            diagonal moves unless the path actually links the two tiles.
            GNA#20472
          + Rulesets can allow units to paradrop directly onto transport
            units. GNAPATCH#3805
          + Rulesets have more control over when units can enter and leave
            'unreachable' transports (usually air transports). By default,
            cargo of such transports can no longer embark/disembark unless
            in a city or a base native to the transport, but exceptions
            can be made for individual units. GNAPATCH#3804
          + The game now enforces that no transport unit may contain a
            unit which could transport it, and that units can be nested no
            more than six deep, even if the ruleset would allow these
            situations. This may simplify defining complex transport
            relations in rulesets without defining many unit classes.
            GNA#22050
            (Some versions of 2.4.x had attempts to enforce this, but they
            merely caused error messages rather than preventing the
            situation from occurring.)
     * Terrain and alterations
          + More flexible bases:
               o Rulesets can now define bases which are allowed on city
                 tiles, or automatically added to cities. GNAPATCH#3826
               o Ability and time to build bases can now be
                 terrain-dependent. GNAPATCH#3152
               o Owned bases can now display their owner's flag.
                 GNAPATCH#3450
          + Rulesets can now use effects to change when any of the
            built-in terrain alterations and transformations can be
            performed by units (in 2.4, it was only possible to affect
            irrigation). The full set is:
               o Irrig_Possible: is building irrigation possible?
               o Mining_Possible: is building a mine possible?
               o Irrig_TF_Possible: is changing terrain type with
                 "irrigation" action possible?
               o Mining_TF_Possible: is changing terrain type with "mine"
                 action possible?
               o Transform_Possible: is "transform" action possible?
          + Terrains can now be marked with the 'NotGenerated' flag, so
            that the map generator will not use them (for use in
            scenarios, etc). GNAPATCH#4158
     * Units
          + The unit 'convert' action is no longer instant; it takes a
            ruleset-defined time (at least one turn) for suitable units to
            convert into another type. GNAPATCH#3110
          + The 'Veteran_Build' effect (used for 'Barracks', etc) can now
            cause units to gain multiple veteran levels. GNAPATCH#3062
          + Rulesets are now permitted to contain no city-founding units.
            GNAPATCH#3352
     * Combat
          + Added a general framework for combat value modification based
            on unit type. The old hardcoded 'AEGIS', 'AirUnit', 'Horse',
            'Pikemen', 'Helicopter', and 'Fighter' flags are gone; it's
            now possible to add similar bonuses with different numeric
            values, and more of them. GNAPATCH#3548
          + Whether conquering units reduce city population is now defined
            by the ruleset, per unit class ('KillCitizen'). GNAPATCH#3613
          + Units defending while on non-native terrain (that is, ships in
            harbor) can have a defense penalty applied in this situation,
            via the unit class flag 'non_native_def_pct'. (This is
            distinct from the existing 'BadCityDefender' unit flag, which
            affects firepower.) GNA#20544
          + Sea units' ability to attack neighboring land is generalized
            as ability to attack non-native terrain, and controllable at
            unit class and type level ('AttackNonNative' and
            'Only_Native_Attack' respectively). GNAPATCH#3264
          + Sea units' ability to attack from harbor is generalized as
            unit class ability to attack from city or transport in
            non-native terrain ('AttFromNonNative'). GNAPATCH#3333
     * Cities
          + Cities can suffer ruleset-defined random disasters, whose
            effects can be mediated by the requirements system, and whose
            effects can be implemented by Lua script.
          + The limit on trade routes per city can now vary during
            gameplay (up to a maximum of 5). GNAPATCH#3178 Bonuses,
            ability to establish based on whether route is international
            and/or intercontinental, and what happens if a trade route
            becomes invalid are all now ruleset configurable.
            GNAPATCH#3444
          + As well as the changes to nationality listed in the gameplay
            section:
               o Rulesets can use the "Nationality" requirement in effects
                 to test whether cities contain citizens of a specific
                 nationality. GNAPATCH#3623
               o Rulesets can control whether and how much enemy citizens
                 cause unhappiness with the "Enemy_Citizen_Unhappy_Pct"
                 effect. GNAPATCH#3684
               o Rulesets can choose whether partisan appearance depends
                 on the original city owner or the current nationality of
                 the citizens, and if so what proportion is required for
                 partisans. GNAPATCH#3762
          + The 'Inspire_Partisans' effect can now depend on properties of
            a specific city, not just player-wide requirements.
            GNAPATCH#3763
          + Specialists can now define a fallback graphics tag, so that
            rulesets with custom specialists can be played without tileset
            support. GNAPATCH#4239
          + The image to display for a city (City_Image) is now calculated
            on the server side, allowing ruleset authors to use
            requirements for it that the client may not have reliable
            access to. GNA#19952
          + The way city size is converted into a (cosmetic) population
            number is now more configurable. GNAPATCH#3406
     * Technology
          + New effect 'Not_Tech_Source' prevents players from having
            technology stolen from them. GNAPATCH#3546
          + When a player gets a free technology, the method used to
            choose it is defined in the ruleset in 'free_tech_method'.
            Instead of the previous behavior of giving the player their
            currently researched technology, the ruleset can now specify
            the cheapest or a random technology. GNAPATCH#3552
            GNAPATCH#3553
          + New tech_upkeep_style 'Cities', where tech upkeep scales with
            number of cities.
          + A player will no longer lose a technology (due to tech upkeep,
            etc) if it's a root_req for another technology the player
            knows. GNA#19176
          + The ruleset can request that technology help be popped up in
            the client when a new technology is acquired, via
            'popup_tech_help'. (This can be overridden by the user.)
            GNAPATCH#3480
     * Nations
          + Nations can have an associated color; if the server setting
            'plrcolormode' is set to the new value 'NATION_ORDER',
            players' colors will depend on their nation. GNAPATCH#3443
          + Rulesets can now define playable subsets of their nations
            ('nation sets'), one of which can be picked by players during
            game setup. This could be used for instance to define a number
            of different balanced sets of nations which have unique
            traits, perhaps tailored to different numbers of players.
            GNAPATCH#3448
          + The list of supplied nations has been split out to a new
            'nationlist.ruleset', so that rulesets can use these nations
            while changing other aspects of 'nations.ruleset'.
            nationlist.ruleset has its own lists of governments, terrains,
            etc, so that it can be used by rulesets that are slightly
            different without errors.
     * Effects and requirements
          + 'Resource' added as requirement to effects system.
            GNAPATCH#3322
          + City effects can now depend on the presence of terrain with
            certain properties within the city's workable radius, by
            specifying 'Terrain', 'Resource', etc with 'City' range.
            GNAPATCH#3740
          + City effects can now place requirements on the city's own
            tile. GNA#19874
          + Expanded the ability to group ruleset objects into sets for
            requirement purposes with custom flags:
               o Terrains and technologies now have custom flags, as well
                 as units, enabling limited disjunctive ("or") requirement
                 definitions for these types. GNAPATCH#3487 GNAPATCH#4074
               o Requirements can test these flags. GNAPATCH#3395
                 GNAPATCH#4069
               o User flags now have ruleset-defined help text.
               o The maximum number of user flags for unit types has
                 increased from 4 to 16 (as these are used for the combat
                 bonuses framework). GNAPATCH#3393
          + For boolean effects, negative values are now evaluated as
            'false', to ease ruleset development. GNAPATCH#3396
     * Lua scripting
          + Updated scripting engine to Lua 5.2. GNAPATCH#3230
          + Scripts can now set tile labels. GNAPATCH#3136
          + Scripts can now run on a new 'map_generated' signal.
            GNAPATCH#3135
     * Misc
          + It's now possible to have multiple centers of government for
            the purposes of calculating waste and corruption, through the
            'Gov_Center' effect. The distance to the nearest determines
            waste. GNAPATCH#3342
          + When a 'GameLoss' unit is killed, instead of the player's
            assets (units, cities, etc) just disappearing, the ruleset can
            cause some of them to be transferred to the conqueror,
            barbarians, and/or a new AI player ('gameloss_style').
            GNA#20577
          + Rulesets can specify that start positions must be surrounded
            by a minimum area whose terrain is native to starting units
            ('min_start_native_area'). GNAPATCH#3614
          + Rulesets can completely disable civil war
            ('civil_war_enabled'). GNAPATCH#3818
          + Technologies with the 'Claim_Ocean' flag lift the normal
            restrictions on borders claiming ocean tiles. GNAPATCH#3355
          + The ruleset can define a 'preferred_soundset' which will be
            suggested to clients. (Only Gtk2/3 clients can ask the user;
            with other clients the user has to have enabled auto-accept
            for this to take effect.) GNAPATCH#3226

   Tileset authors have a few new facilities. Existing tilesets need
   changes to work with 2.5 at all; see
   <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/How_to_update_a_tileset_from_2.4_to_2.5>
   for a minimal recipe.
     * When a unit is building a base or road, tilesets can now display an
       icon specific to that base/road. GNAPATCH#3305
     * The layer that darkness is drawn at is now configurable
       ('darkness_layer'). GNAPATCH#4461
     * Tilesets can now supply icons for unit upkeep greater than 2 to be
       displayed in the city dialog. GNAPATCH#3824
     * In the supplied tilesets, government and specialist icons have been
       split to separate files, so custom tilesets can replace them while
       continuing to use other graphics from the standard small.spec.
       GNAPATCH#4076 GNAPATCH#4422

   Scenario creators have a couple of new features available. (Scenarios
   created with previous versions should continue to work in 2.5.)
     * Most of the supplied rulesets now include an 'Inaccessible' terrain
       type, for use by scenario authors to shape the map area. See the
       France scenario for an example of its use. GNAPATCH#4159
       GNAPATCH#4158
     * Scenarios can now restrict the set of available nations (to those
       with start positions). GNA#21268

Changes affecting server operators

     * Failure to load a ruleset no longer causes the server to quit; it
       now reverts to the previously loaded ruleset, or failing that the
       default ruleset. GNAPATCH#1449
     * On Windows, the server no longer sets the socket option
       SO_REUSEADDR on its listening socket. This may fix some issues with
       clients connecting to the wrong server. GNA#21583
     * The default database backend for authentication has changed from
       MySQL to SQLite. GNA#19909
     * There's no longer support for attempting to save games in formats
       compatible with previous major releases of Freeciv. The
       'saveversion' server option has been removed. GNAPATCH#3188
       GNAPATCH#3026

AI

   There have been some improvements to the standard AI's behavior:
     * Defense
          + Autosettlers are smarter about spotting danger: GNAPATCH#3854
               o Sea and air units are now considered threats, not just
                 land units.
               o Military units which can't attack are no longer
                 considered threats.
          + Cities needing defense are less prone to building walls before
            units. GNAPATCH#4798
          + The AI now considers non-land units that can conquer cities
            (such as Helicopters) a threat to continents it controls.
            GNA#22225
          + The AI should more correctly account for travel time when
            assessing danger to cities from enemy units; previously it
            treated them as its own, which could be wrong for ZoC,
            restrictinfra etc. GNAPATCH#3729
          + (as of RC1) The city the AI has nominated to build wonders is
            now permitted to build defensive units instead if necessary.
            GNAPATCH#5588
          + (as of RC1) The AI now treats players it has never met as
            potentially hostile; this should make it harder for human
            players to sneak forces into place before first diplomatic
            contact. GNAPATCH#5441
     * Unit handling
          + Some fixes to AI's handling of boats as transports.
     * Terrain improvement
          + The AI and autosettlers' relative weightings have been tweaked
            to give slightly better behavior with typical rulesets. In
            particular, production is now valued less compared to other
            outputs. GNAPATCH#3692
          + The AI and autosettlers can now decide to build bases, if they
            provide any direct output bonus to a nearby city, or enable
            another base which does so. (Bases are still not built for
            purely strategic purposes.) GNAPATCH#3341 GNAPATCH#3833
     * Economy
          + When the AI is on a war footing, it now prefers diverting
            taxes to science rather than luxury. GNA#21640
          + The AI now considers keeping units in cities for their martial
            law effect, although it will not yet build units specially for
            this. GNAPATCH#3959
          + The AI values coinage less, to balance it compared to
            gold-producing buildings. GNA#21796
          + The AI may now create trade routes between continents.
            GNAPATCH#2963
     * Research
          + The AI now considers more combat bonuses when deciding what
            technology to research. For instance, it may now work harder
            towards AEGIS Cruiser when defending against air units.
            GNAPATCH#3555 GNAPATCH#3563
          + The AI no longer chases technologies to gain units that are
            already obsolete. GNAPATCH#4013
          + The AI no longer remembers its past desire for long-obsolete
            technologies indefinitely. GNA#22260
     * Ruleset tolerance
          + In rulesets which support ocean cities, the AI now considers
            building them. GNAPATCH#3533
          + The AI no longer builds sea-only worker units if the ruleset
            has them. This is a temporary solution to a previous issue
            where AI would build only sea worker units when they became
            available, and not land ones. GNAPATCH#4610

   AI behavior is also now somewhat more configurable by rulesets:
     * The new traits framework allows AI behavior to be parameterized
       (current traits are Expansionist/Trader/Aggressive). Traits can be
       set in rulesets (globally or for specific nations), or by Lua
       script. GNAPATCH#3001
     * The 'Cheating' level AI no longer intrinsically ignores tax rate
       limitations. This is instead left up to the ruleset. The supplied
       rulesets give cheating AIs this bonus, so there is no functional
       change. GNA#18232

   The following changes are only relevant to AI developers:
     * 'Default' AI logic, which was previously tied to the 'classic' AI
       type, can now be used selectively by custom AI modules, each with
       their own instance data.
     * The default AI type can be chosen at configure time. GNAPATCH#3666
     * Some progress has been made on the 'threaded' AI variant. It is now
       functional, but does not yet offer much advantage over the
       'classic' AI. The only difference is that cities can make specific
       requests of worker units. The 'threaded' AI is not included in
       standard builds.

Clients

     * (as of beta2) The Qt client is now substantially complete, and a
       Windows build is available. A Qt version of the modpack installer
       is also available.
     * The city map size in the city dialog now adapts to the ruleset.
       This means that the city dialog in the SDL client is no longer
       unusably small with the classic and similar rulesets. GNAPATCH#4389
     * The client now only lists scenarios for "Start Scenario Game";
       previously it could include ordinary save files that happened to be
       on the scenario path. GNA#22209
     * Client options to control whether tileset and soundset suggestions
       made by the ruleset are automatically accepted. This allows clients
       other than the Gtk clients to make use of these suggestions.
       GNAPATCH#3599 GNAPATCH#3605
     * (Gtk) The pregame nation selection dialog has been rewritten,
       fixing many small bugs. GNAPATCH#4347
     * (Gtk) The client can now optionally pop up help for a new
       technology when it's acquired. GNAPATCH#3608

Modpack installer

     * The modpack installer now keeps track of versions of packages it
       has previously installed. (It does not track changes made
       manually.) GNAPATCH#3163
     * A command-line tool for downloading modpacks, freeciv-mp-cli, has
       been created for use on headless servers. GNAPATCH#4436
     * The modpack installer can be built into multiple GUI flavored
       executables simultaneously. As a result, the executables have been
       renamed.
     * Modpacks can now have descriptions GNAPATCH#3645 and a 'subtype'
       field (e.g. to distinguish iso/hex tilesets) GNAPATCH#4394.

Tilesets / Art

     * The activity icons shown near units building roads and bases in
       Cimpletoon, Amplio2, and Trident are now small versions of the
       extras themselves. GNAPATCH#4059 GNA#20032 GNAPATCH#5856
     * (as of RC2) The Trident tileset has been updated for various
       recently added game elements, including lake and maglev.
       GNAPATCH#5856 GNAPATCH#5877
     * Improve colors for global warming / nuclear winter progress
       indicators. GNAPATCH#4827
     * The icons for entertainers, scientists, and tax collectors now have
       both male and female versions. GNAPATCH#4506
     * Made a few specialist icons available for custom rulesets (worker,
       farmer, merchant) for use by modpacks. These are not used in the
       supplied rulesets. GNAPATCH#4467
     * The Cimpletoon and Amplio2 (as of RC1) and Trident (as of RC2)
       tilesets have 'outpost' and 'airstrip' graphics for use by
       modpacks. GNAPATCH#5027

Translations

     * Updated French, Polish, Catalan, Russian, Korean, Scottish Gaelic,
       British English, traditional Chinese, Spanish, German, Japanese,
       Finnish, and Irish localizations.

Build/portability

     * A real thread implementation is now a hard requirement.
       GNAPATCH#2996
     * The SDL client now requires SDL_gfx and SDL_ttf libraries. Copies
       are no longer included with the Freeciv source. GNAPATCH#4088
       GNAPATCH#4386
     * Clients other than the SDL client can now be built against
       SDL2_mixer. GNAPATCH#4189
     * (as of beta2) The build is now Clang-clean (with 3.3, 3.4, and
       3.5).

   See doc/README.packaging for more information.


MAJOR CHANGES FROM 2.3.x to 2.4.0
---------------------------------

   (from <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-2.4.0>)

   As is usual for major releases, 2.4 clients cannot interoperate with
   pre-2.4 servers, and vice versa. Pre-2.4 savegames can however be
   loaded into 2.4, and in most cases, the supplied rulesets have not
   changed so much as to make it difficult to complete a game started with
   2.3.x's rules.

Server / General

Gameplay

     * The maximum theoretical map size has increased from 128,000 to
       2,048,000 tiles; the maximum linear map dimension has increased
       from 512 to 32,768. GNA#18087
     * If map generation fails (for instance the common failure to
       allocate start positions), it is now retried with a different
       random seed. GNAPATCH#2402
     * A couple of new server settings have been added to customise
       gameplay:
          + 'revealmap' allows the map to be shown to all players at game
            start, or to dead players. GNAPATCH#2379
          + 'first_timeout' allows the first turn to have a different
            timeout from subsequent turns. GNAPATCH#1967

Clerical

     * Player authentication has been revamped. Database access is now
       mediated by a Lua script that can be customised by server
       operators, and uses Luasql, enabling a variety of backends: MySQL
       (the only backend supported previously), SQLite, and PostgreSQL.
       See doc/README.fcdb for details. GNA#13643
          + Support is included 'out of the box' for SQLite and MySQL
            databases. SQLite uses a simple file as a database, and is
            recommended as being entirely adequate for Freeciv
            authentication and much less hassle to set up than MySQL.
          + The Windows packages include SQLite support, so for the first
            time, it's possible to use player authentication on Windows
            without building the server yourself.
     * The server now supports a 'delegation' feature similar to that in
       Longturn, where one user can nominate another to temporarily take
       over control of the game. This is controlled by the '/delegate'
       server command. GNAPATCH#2121
     * There is a new "map image" feature to save an overview map as an
       image. This is a much expanded version of the previous --Ppm server
       feature, which has been removed. Compared to --Ppm, the new feature
       can distinguish units, cities, borders, terrain colors, hex tiles,
       and more. Saving images can be triggered automatically (turn-based)
       on the server, or on demand on the server or client. See the
       '/mapimg' server command. GNAPATCH#1391
          + A series of these images can be assembled into an animation to
            replay the progress of the game. A shell script 'mapimg2anim'
            is provided to help with this.
          + PNG/GIF/JPEG output is only available if built against the
            ImageMagick library; this is included in the Windows packages
            as of 2.4.0-RC1.
     * Player colors are now assigned centrally, and can be changed with
       the '/playercolor' server command. There is a new server setting
       'plrcolormode' that controls how colors are assigned, including a
       mode where all players on a team have the same color. GNAPATCH#2062
          + The set of default player colors in the supplied rulesets has
            been reworked to enhance visibility of borders against
            terrain, etc. GNA#19778
     * The colors used to represent different terrain types on the minimap
       have been reworked. GNAPATCH#2069
     * The 'autosaves' setting gives finer control over when savegames are
       generated. GNAPATCH#2536
          + To disable autosaves entirely, instead of '/set saveturns 0',
            it's now necessary to use a command like '/set autosaves ""'.
     * The scripts 'ser' and 'civ' have been renamed to 'fcser' and
       'fcgui' respectively. GNAPATCH#2830
     * A Lua script can be read from a file with the '/lua file' command.
       Direct Lua input is now via the '/lua cmd' command. GNAPATCH#2338
       GNAPATCH#2869
     * New server option --Bind-meta to control which network interface
       the metaserver connection is made from. GNA#14106
     * The server can be built with support for .xz (LZMA) compression for
       saved games, etc. See the 'compresstype' option. GNAPATCH#1810
     * The freeciv-modpack utility supports more modpack types, more
       options (see --help), and uses the Curl library for network access
       so should be more robust.
     * (as of beta2) The ranklog format has changed; it now includes
       individual players' scores, and can be parsed more unambiguously.
       GNAPATCH#3346

Clients

     * There is a new client, freeciv-gtk3, based on version 3 of the Gtk+
       toolkit. This is fully playable and has largely identical UI and
       functionality to freeciv-gtk2. Currently it is experimental;
       however, it is expected that it will become the default client in
       the next major release.
          + The first time you run this client, it will copy any Gtk2
            client settings you have set. Thereafter, Gtk2 and Gtk3
            settings will remain separate.
          + Known issue in beta1/beta2: when compiled against some
            versions of Gtk3, there are assertion failures and crashes
            associated with the unit selection dialog. This is believed
            due to a Gtk bug (671939); however, it's been worked around in
            the Freeciv code as of RC1. GNA#19846
     * (In the code there is also the start of a Qt client. However, at
       this point it is just a stub and is unlikely to be of interest.
       Development will continue in 2.5.)
     * A server spawned by the client now only listens on the local
       network interface, so clients on other machines cannot connect to
       it. This improves security for single-player games, but means that
       a multiplayer game can no longer be hosted by the client; you must
       start a separate server instead (see the FAQ). GNA#18530
     * It's now possible to display a map overlay indicating which tiles
       the currently selected unit can enter ("native" tiles), with the
       Shift-Ctrl-N keyboard shortcut. GNA#13620
     * The research speed in bulbs per turn is now available with other
       research information from popups/tooltips on the main window.
       GNA#17685 GNA#16481
     * For rulesets where different nations have unique gameplay
       attributes (different initial governments, techs, units, or
       buildings), this information is now available when picking a nation
       in the pregame, and in the online help. GNAPATCH#3066
     * The client now displays the current stable version of Freeciv and
       whether that's newer than the running version (this information
       comes from the metaserver). GNAPATCH#2735
     * (Gtk) The client now has a Lua scripting console. GNAPATCH#2515
          + This is currently something of a proof of concept rather than
            a finished feature, as a comprehensive API suitable for the
            client-side has not been provided. Notably, there are not yet
            any signals from which client-side scripts can be triggered.
          + However, client scripts do have access to the client's view of
            most of the same game data that server-side ruleset scripts do
            (map, units, cities etc); see the Lua reference manual. This
            should be sufficient for some useful work. For example, it
            should in principle be possible to implement an on-demand
            optimal trade route calculator with these facilities (although
            we haven't tried).
     * (Gtk) The unit selection dialog has been revamped to allow browsing
       and selecting units by combinations of location and activity,
       anywhere in the world. GNA#17236
     * (Gtk) A bribe cost is now shown in the popup for units (for enemy
       units, this is estimated). GNA#17489

Tilesets / Art

     * The orientation of units is now tracked, so tilesets can provide
       different graphics for different unit orientations. GNAPATCH#2719
          + A tileset making use of this, Cimpletoon, is included. It is
            based on Amplio2 but has a full set of oriented unit sprites
            for the default ruleset. GNAPATCH#2739
          + Known issue in beta1: Cimpletoon did not have sprites for all
            Fundamentalist units (it lacked Elephants and Crusaders), so
            for rulesets with these units, it would use fallback sprites
            (Chariot and Knights respectively). As of beta2, the tileset
            is complete. GNA#19998

Gameplay / Rules

Changes affecting supplied rulesets

     * Nations:
          + The number of playable nations has increased from 385 to 539.
          + Out of these, a subset of 50 "core" nations has been defined,
            based mostly on nations that have appeared in the Civilization
            series of games. For localised versions of Freeciv, these
            nations are more likely to be translated than the remainder.
            Players are initially presented with the core set, and it will
            be used for random nation selection if no nations are
            specifically selected; but players can still select nations
            outside the core set, and if some do, then the full range of
            supplied nations will be used for random selection of
            remaining players. GNAPATCH#3449 GNAPATCH#3432
          + The civ1 and civ2 rulesets now have their own separate nation
            sets, more closely matching the original games. GNAPATCH#2243
     * City center tiles now lose their automatic irrigation bonus if a
       mine is built on them, since mines and irrigation cannot coexist on
       a tile. GNA#20932
          + Similarly, in the supplied rulesets, cities on a tile with a
            mine can no longer get a farmland bonus.
     * The effect of veterancy on the cost of bribing a unit now depends
       on veteran bonuses, not numeric veteran level; bribe costs for
       veteran units have thus changed. GNA#19253
     * When the 'barbarians' server setting is disabled, huts no longer
       spawn barbarians.
     * When migration is enabled, citizens now consider the risk of plague
       when deciding whether to migrate. GNA#17740
     * In rulesets without tech upkeep enabled, if the bulb count goes
       negative (for instance due to 'conquercost'), technologies are no
       longer lost. This restores the behavior of previous versions of
       Freeciv. GNA#19487
     * Diplomats and Spies now have special names for their veteran
       levels, but behavior is unchanged from 2.3. GNA#19850
     * In the default, multiplayer, and experimental rulesets, years are
       displayed with CE/BCE rather than BC/AD notation. GNA#15090
     * (as of beta2) The default map topology for new games has been
       changed to isometric, to match the default Amplio2 tileset.
       GNAPATCH#3764
     * (as of beta2) In the 'multiplayer' ruleset, the ability to build
       buoys has been removed, as they do not work well with national
       borders disabled (the default for this ruleset). It is expected
       that they'll be re-enabled in a future major release. GNAPATCH#3541
     * Changes to the 'experimental' ruleset:
          + Citizen nationality is enabled; see below.
          + Workers and Engineers can now gain veteran levels by working
            the land; this in turn allows them to work faster.
            GNAPATCH#2370 GNA#19818
          + A Mech. Inf. unit can now carry up to three Missile units.
            GNAPATCH#2481
          + Galleons can now carry Big Land units, and Frigates no longer
            can. Old savegames are handled gracefully. GNAPATCH#2643

Changes and new features for rulesets/modpacks/scenarios

     * New feature: optionally, the nationality of citizens can be
       tracked. For instance, when you conquer a city, its citizens retain
       their original nationality. Currently this affects the cost of
       inciting cities and the chance of migration (if enabled); more
       effects are planned for future versions. GNAPATCH#2265
     * The veteran system has been reworked:
          + Per-unit veteran levels have been generalised; all veteran
            properties can now be set on a per-unit basis; previously, the
            chances of moving between levels could not. This means that
            different units can now usefully have different numbers of
            veteran levels for the first time. GNAPATCH#2346
          + Diplomatic combat and spy mission survival chances are now
            derived directly from the 'power_fact' property of the veteran
            level, rather than being based purely on the numeric veteran
            level. GNA#19850
          + As noted above, the effect of veterancy on unit bribe costs
            has changed.
          + The maximum number of veteran levels has doubled from 10 to
            20.
          + Units with only a single veteran level, or which can't become
            veteran, now do not have a veteran level displayed.
          + Information about veteran levels is now included in the
            on-line help. GNA#19851
     * Recursive transports are now supported (up to a depth of 5).
       GNAPATCH#2270
     * Two new tech_cost_styles: 3 with a new formula (early techs
       slightly easier, later techs much harder), and 4 which is similar
       to 2 (read from ruleset) but with the gaps filled with the new
       formula. GNAPATCH#2396
     * A new effect 'Irrig_Possible' and requirement range 'CAdjacent'
       (cardinally adjacent) have been added. The requirement for oceans
       or rivers for irrigation is thus no longer hardcoded and can be
       modified. GNAPATCH#2450
     * The 'CityTile' requirement now supports 'Adjacent' and 'CAdjacent'
       ranges, so effects can be triggered for tiles next to a city.
       GNA#18551
     * 'Surviving' requirements for wonders are now supported at Player
       range as well as at World range. GNA#17463
     * In ruleset definitions, specifying 'move_type' for a unit is now
       optional; if not specified it will be inferred from the native
       terrains/specials of the unit. GNA#13630 GNAPATCH#2991
     * A ruleset can now specify a 'default_government' for all its
       nations in nations.ruleset, rather than each nation being required
       to specify its initial government individually. GNAPATCH#3031
          + The supplied nations no longer include
            init_government="Despotism", so they can be used in rulesets
            which require a different initial government. GNAPATCH#3032
     * The image used for a city in the client is now set by the effects
       system (effect 'City_Image'), so it's no longer constrained to be a
       simple function of city size. GNA#17110
          + The experimental ruleset uses this to align city graphics with
            the city map radius.
     * Tile labels are supported. These are text labels that are displayed
       by all clients when they display a particular map tile. They can be
       added to scenarios in the editor. GNAPATCH#2408
     * The colors used for players, and for terrains on the minimap and
       map images, are now specified by the ruleset on the server side,
       rather than the tileset on the client side. GNAPATCH#2060
       GNAPATCH#2061
     * In rulesets with tech_leakage enabled, dead players are no longer
       taken into account in the calculation; so you cannot gain from
       their knowledge, but equally a dead, ignorant player no longer
       pushes up research costs. GNAPATCH#2956
     * The behavior where the senate of representative governments is
       bypassed has moved from the Any_Government to the No_Anarchy
       effect. GNA#19107
     * The 'min_dist_bw_cities' ruleset item has been retired; use the
       'citymindist' option instead. GNAPATCH#2537
     * Many changes to ruleset Lua scripting -- for full details see the
       Lua reference manual. These are all backward compatible.
       Highlights:
          + Script-triggered climate change (GNAPATCH#2624) and civil war
            (GNAPATCH#2627).
          + Scripts can now move existing units.
          + A script can test whether tiles have a particular base.
            GNAPATCH#2672
          + Script facilities for reading and manipulating unit
            orientation. GNAPATCH#2823 GNAPATCH#2836
          + Scripts can now read server settings. GNAPATCH#2955
     * (as of beta2) An internal 64kbyte limit on string length has been
       removed. Among other things, this allows longer Lua scripts in
       scenarios. GNA#20086

AI

     * (as of beta2) The city governor logic has been reworked, fixing
       various issues such as unexpected tax collectors in cities with
       many buildings, and a need to set minimal gold surplus to a lower
       target than expected. GNAPATCH#3620
     * (as of beta2) The AI's workers/settlers, and human players'
       autosettlers, will now automatically stop what they are doing and
       go elsewhere if threatened by an enemy unit and there is no
       defender on their tile. (Currently only threats from land units are
       considered.) GNAPATCH#3384
     * (as of beta2) Improvements to AI settler management:
          + The AI now considers worker units' food consumption (e.g.
            Settlers) to be less of a factor when deciding whether to
            build such units, to encourage it to do so. GNAPATCH#3693
          + Fix poor handling of rulesets containing boats which can only
            carry a single unit. Previously, the AI would generate
            settlers with the intention of sending them out on such boats,
            but then refuse to do so due to lack of room for a bodyguard,
            regardless of whether one was needed, often hurting expansion
            and leaving useless settlers. Now it only insists on room for
            a bodyguard if one is actually needed. GNA#19815
     * Improvements to AI city defense:
          + (as of beta2) Reduced the tendency of AI city defenders to be
            lured out of their city by nearby targets even in the presence
            of threats. GNA#20504
          + (as of beta2) Cities in grave danger of invasion with no
            defending units were tending to build City Walls, uselessly.
            They will now prioritise acquiring a defender. GNA#20559
          + (as of RC1) Reduced the weighting of the AI's assessment of
            defence strength, so that it defends its own cities more
            convincingly. (part of GNAPATCH#3960)
          + (as of RC1) The AI now tends to keep a unit constantly
            defending each of its cities even in the absence of an obvious
            threat, rather than relying on being able to acquire one when
            a threat appears. GNAPATCH#3958
     * (as of beta2) Improvements to AI caravan management:
          + Caravans in transit are now taken into account when a city is
            deciding whether to build more caravans. Previously, a city
            could end up building endless caravans if existing ones did
            not complete their trade route. GNAPATCH#3529
     * (as of RC1) The AI's new weighting of defence strength assessment
       means that it is less fearful of its enemy's defenders when
       attacking their cities. (part of GNAPATCH#3960)
     * The AI's management of its tax rates has been reworked to be more
       sophisticated; notably, it now takes tech upkeep into account. It
       also considers tech upkeep when determining the value of a tech.
       GNAPATCH#2251
     * AI planning for new cities has been improved slightly. GNA#19449
     * Autosettler planning for building railroads (GNAPATCH#2885,
       GNA#19560) and farmland (GNAPATCH#2889) has been improved. (Note
       that the latter is still only triggered by the existence of a
       Supermarket, so the AI still does not benefit, due to a
       chicken-and-egg situation.)
     * The extensive reworking of the AI code (see #Development), while
       not intended to introduce any functional changes (and extensively
       tested for this), may have changed behavior in some rare cases.

Translations

     * New Indonesian translation.
     * (as of beta2) New Traditional Chinese translation.
     * Updated translations: Bulgarian, Catalan, Spanish, Scottish Gaelic,
       Korean, Polish, Dutch, Irish, French, German, Finnish, and British
       English.

Development

     * The AI code has been heavily refactored, with a view to making it
       easier for people to start their own projects to write better
       Freeciv AI.
          + There's now a concept of AI type; different players can have
            different AIs. The type can be specified to the server /create
            command and the Lua function edit.create_player().
          + The server can be built to accept dynamically loadable AI
            modules with the --enable-aimodules option to configure. A
            module is loaded by starting the server with the --LoadAI
            option.
          + Alternatively, a fixed set of modules can be compiled in with
            --enable-ai-static.
          + In addition to the 'classic' AI, the standard Freeciv package
            ships with the 'stub' and 'threaded' AIs. These are both dummy
            templates for development and do not work as shipped. They are
            enabled with the configure option
            --enable-aimodules=experimental.
          + See doc/README.AI_modules for some more information.

Build/portability

     * There is now a hard dependency on libcurl for HTTP access. This is
       used for metaserver communication and for freeciv-modpack.
       GNAPATCH#2320 GNAPATCH#2376
     * Efforts have been made to make the codebase compile without
       warnings with GCC 4.6 and (as of beta2) 4.7.
     * Use of some GNU make extensions has been removed from the build
       system, so it may now be possible to build with a POSIX 'make'.
       GNAPATCH#3378
     * freeciv-modpack can be built against either gtk2 or gtk3.
       GNAPATCH#2762
     * The configure option --enable-sys-lua allows use of a system-wide
       copy of Lua instead of the one shipped with Freeciv. GNAPATCH#2747

   See doc/README.packaging for more information.


MAJOR CHANGES FROM 2.2.x to 2.3.0
---------------------------------

   (from <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-2.3.0>)

   As well as many new features, many features from Longturn and some from
   Warclient have been merged into the main codebase for this release.

   A new program has been added to the Freeciv suite: 'freeciv-modpack'.
   This makes it easier to download and install add-ons ('modpacks':
   rulesets, tilesets, etc) to the right place; you can enter a URL,
   choose an add-on from the list, and the tool will install it to the
   correct place for this version of Freeciv to use it. Modpack authors
   should see this page for details of how to publish modpacks for
   installation by this program. GNAPATCH#1822

   As is usual for major releases, 2.3 clients cannot interoperate with
   pre-2.3 servers, and vice versa. Pre-2.3 savegames can however be
   loaded into 2.3, and in most cases, the supplied rulesets have not
   changed so much as to make it difficult to complete a game started with
   2.2.x's rules.

Server / General

Gameplay

     * Various limits have been lifted, including:
          + Maximum number of simultaneous players increased from 30 to
            126 GNAPATCH#1731
          + Map size
               o Maximum map size increased from 30,000 to 128,000 tiles;
                 maximum linear map dimensions increased from 254 to 512
                 GNAPATCH#1733
               o Minimum map size reduced to 16x16(!) GNA#17031
          + Allow goto paths that take more than 99 turns GNA#16792
     * There are now more ways of specifying the map size. Instead of
       specifying the size in thousands of tiles (via the 'size' option),
       you can specify the number of tiles per player ('tilesperplayer'),
       or the exact X and Y sizes ('xsize' and 'ysize'). The method is
       selected with the 'mapsize' option. GNAPATCH#1720
     * A number of new server settings have been added to customise
       gameplay:
          + 'killunhomed': units without a home city (such as starting
            units) can be configured to lose hitpoints each turn until
            they die. GNAPATCH#1501
          + 'unreachableprotects' controls whether 'unreachable' units
            (such as Bombers) protect the whole stack on their tile as in
            previous versions. If this is unset, a mixed stack is
            vulnerable to attack (including normally-unreachable units).
            GNAPATCH#1850
          + 'unitwaittime' allows a minimum time to be enforced between
            actions of a given unit on successive turns, to mitigate the
            'double-move problem'. GNAPATCH#1500
          + 'restrictinfra' allows enemy use of infrastructure such as
            roads and rails to be restricted. GNAPATCH#1266
          + 'airliftingstyle' allows airlifts between allied cities, and
            unlimited airlifts per turn. GNAPATCH#1189
          + 'techlost_recv'/'techlost_donor' allow introduction of a risk
            of technology loss when technologies are transferred between
            civilizations (via diplomacy, espionage, conquest etc).
            GNAPATCH#1263
          + 'trading_tech'/'trading_gold'/'trading_city' allow certain
            types of diplomatic agreements to be selectively disabled.
            GNAPATCH#1504, GNAPATCH#1506
          + 'globalwarming'/'nuclearwinter' allow these global
            catastrophes to be disabled. GNAPATCH#1505
          + 'team_pooled_research' allows pooled research to be disabled.
            GNAPATCH#1868
          + 'alliedvictory': all players in an alliance can share victory.
            This new behaviour is enabled by default. GNA#14278
     * (as of rc1) Changes to the 'timeout' setting now always have
       immediate effect, as in 2.0.x; previously, changes between non-zero
       values would not take effect until the next turn. GNA#18079
     * Improvements to observing:
          + The demographic report is now available to global observers.
            GNA#16486
          + Global observers can now view the city report (it shows cities
            from all nations). GNA#16699 GNAPATCH#2571
          + Global observers can now access the buildable target list in
            the city dialog. GNA#16487
     * The number of units built, killed, etc now contributes to the final
       score, and appears in the endgame report. GNAPATCH#1870
     * Changing a unit's activity is now more forgiving: if you
       accidentally stop an activity such as irrigation, but restart it
       without doing anything else, progress is no longer lost. GNA#15510

Clerical

     * Settings configuration on the client and server has been reworked.
       The most notable change is that enumerated and bitwise options are
       now set with strings instead of numbers (for instance, '/set
       barbarians hordes' instead of 4, '/set topology wrapx|wrapy'
       instead of 3). GNAPATCH#1301
     * The FREECIV_PATH environment variable can be overridden by three
       new variables: FREECIV_DATA_PATH, FREECIV_SAVE_PATH, and
       FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH. GNA#14624
     * Add-ons are now loaded from a sub-path ~/.freeciv/<version>/ (e.g.,
       ~/.freeciv/2.3/), since they tend to be specific to a version of
       Freeciv. GNA#14624
     * Servers send more information to the metaserver:
          + The 'timeout' and 'aifill' options (GNAPATCH#2092);
          + (as of beta2) the number of human players (as opposed to AIs)
            (GNAPATCH#2312); as of beta3 this is displayed in the client
            (GNAPATCH#2411)
     * New server command '/kick' and associated option 'kicktime' to lock
       out troublesome users. GNA#16933
     * New server commands '/ignore', '/unignore', and '/list ignored
       users', allowing players to suppress chat messages from specific
       users. GNAPATCH#1910
     * The '/create' command can now create a new player even in a running
       game. GNAPATCH#1574
     * New command '/lua' to execute a line of Lua script on the server
       command line. GNA#15644
     * More options have been added to the '/reset' command. GNAPATCH#1284
     * The name of the scorelog file is configurable with the new
       'scorefile' option. GNAPATCH#1750
     * The current ruleset can be shown by '/show rulesetdir' instead of
       '/rulesetdir' (this allows less privileged users to do so).
       GNA#16636
     * Observers can see the current votes in progress with the new
       command '/list votes'. GNA#16635
     * The server uses a new format for savegames. It can load savegames
       generated by old versions of Freeciv, but old versions will not be
       able to load new savegames. GNAPATCH#1541
          + Support has been added for future versions of Freeciv to save
            backward-compatible savegames (back to 2.3.0) via the
            'saveversion' server option.

Clients

     * Various report screens have been reworked so as not to redraw and
       lose their selections after a few seconds. GNA#16439
     * The total revenue from trade routes is now visible in the city
       report. GNA#16812
     * The chat log file name is now configurable. GNAPATCH#1749
     * (GTK) Some rework of the pregame connection screen and menus
       (GNA#16685). Buttons on this screen now adapt to selected
       player/user (GNA#15300).
     * (GTK) Tab completion of user and player names on the chatline.
       GNAPATCH#1867
     * (GTK) The goto/airlift dialog now shows which nation each city
       belongs to, and more detail on airlift capacity. GNA#15313
       GNAPATCH#2588
     * The research report is now updated when tax rates or city science
       output change. GNA#16776
     * (as of beta2) Improve handling of (non-default) rulesets which
       restrict reachability of technologies (via root_req in the ruleset)
       in the science report. You can now choose whether unreachable
       technologies are displayed. GNA#16852, GNA#16855, etc
     * (as of beta2) (Xaw) The Take Player command is implemented.
       GNAPATCH#2253
     * (as of rc1) In 2.2.x, the "Sell Obsolete" button in the Economy
       report could never be pressed. It has been renamed to "Sell
       Redundant", and now lets 'redundant' buildings be sold en masse
       (redundant buildings are those whose effects are entirely
       superseded by another, for which you may still be paying upkeep --
       for instance, Power Plants are redundant in cities with a
       Hydro/Nuclear/Solar Plants). In the Gtk client, the "Obsolete"
       column in the Economy report has been replaced with a "Redundant"
       column showing how many of each building in your empire are
       redundant. GNA#17937

Gameplay / Rules

Changes affecting supplied rulesets

     * Two new rulesets are included in the distribution:
          + multiplayer: a ruleset based on the default but tuned for
            multiplayer games, based on Madeline Book's "rewonder" ruleset
            for 2.1.
          + experimental: a ruleset showcasing new features of the Freeciv
            "engine", without strict regard for game balance and
            playability. It enables some of the new features mentioned
            below, such as variable city radii.
     * More than doubled the number of playable nations (from 185 to 385).
       Many improvements to existing nations, such as using native
       spellings for cities and leaders.
     * The interaction of promotions and diplomat-vs-diplomat contests has
       changed:
          + Attacking diplomats can now gain experience; previously, only
            defending diplomats gained experience. GNA#17265
          + The effect of veterancy on the outcome of these contests has
            been reduced; it can change the odds by at most 20%
            (previously, elite diplomats could become practically
            invincible). GNA#17264
     * The terrain effects of global warming and nuclear winter are now
       more severe: land can be lost to ocean (and vice versa), and
       glaciers can melt. GNA#17105
     * If migration occurs, citizens take half the food in the granary
       with them. GNAPATCH#1232
     * (as of rc1) In rulesets with Fundamentalism, it now has a happiness
       penalty for empire size (as it did in 2.0.x). GNA#18133
     * (as of rc2) The civ2 ruleset now uses a restricted set of 25
       nations, to better resemble the original game. Loading civ2
       savegames from older versions of Freeciv may cause nations to be
       reassigned; it will not be possible to load a civ2 savegame with
       more than 23 (non-barbarian) players. GNA#18419

New features for ruleset/modpack/scenario authors

   These features have been added to the Freeciv "engine", but aren't
   enabled in standard rulesets (except the experimental ruleset, in some
   cases).
     * Variable city radius: the circle of tiles able to be worked by a
       city is no longer fixed but can vary (radii from 1 to 5 possible)
       depending on requirements defined by the ruleset. GNAPATCH#1235
          + Accordingly, the maximum value for the 'citymindist' server
            option has been increased from 5 to 9. GNAPATCH#2262
     * Build slots: in ruleset-defined circumstances, cities with large
       production surpluses can now produce more than one of a given type
       of unit per turn. GNAPATCH#1234
     * Tech upkeep: rulesets can cause some research output to be diverted
       to maintaining expertise in existing technology rather than
       discovering new technology, with the risk of losing advances if the
       upkeep is not met (similar to gold upkeep for city improvements).
       GNAPATCH#1264
     * Rulesets can define units that can be converted into another type
       of unit on the player's command. GNA#13890
     * Rulesets can define "Capturable" units that can be captured by
       certain other "Capturer" units. (There is an associated server
       option 'homecaughtunits'.) GNAPATCH#1851
     * Rulesets can suggest or mandate server settings. GNA#13873,
       GNAPATCH#1200
     * A start position in a scenario can now be restricted to a set of
       nations rather than a single nation. The built-in editor now
       supports editing this set. GNA#13803
     * Various improvements to Lua scripting. See Events Reference Manual
       for some more detail.

Tilesets / Art

     * New default tileset with redrawn terrain graphics: "Amplio 2". The
       original Amplio tileset is available for 2.3 as an add-on (it can
       be found with the freeciv-modpack utility). GNAPATCH#1777
     * Larger versions of flags and shields are now included in the
       Freeciv distribution for use by larger tilesets; they are used in
       Amplio2 (as of beta4). GNAPATCH#2202

Translations

     * (as of rc2) New Scottish Gaelic localization (complete).
     * (as of beta3) New Irish Gaelic localization (not yet complete:
       55%).
     * Updated translations:
          + Complete translations: Polish, French, Spanish, Catalan, and
            British English.
          + Incomplete translations: Danish (95.8%), Finnish (85%),
            Ukrainian (81%), Italian (74%), Japanese (70%), Brazilian
            Portuguese (70%), Russian (69%), Swedish (60%), Lithuanian
            (43%), and Simplified Chinese (40%).

KNOWN ISSUES

     * There are some regressions in the SDL client relative to 2.2.x:
          + The city dialog has not been redesigned to accommodate the
            larger city map required by variable city radius support. As a
            result, the city map display is scaled down and difficult to
            read. GNA#15804
          + Not all setting types can now be modified; bitwise and color
            settings are not yet supported. GNAPATCH#1631 GNAPATCH#1957

   the client, fx "civclient --tiles trident".
 - While planning a goto (after hitting "g") a line will be displayed
   showing the route from the selected unit to the mouse pointer.

 - Players can agree to give shared vision, which means that you
   automatically see everything the other player sees.

 - Settlers can only be added to cities less than size 8, as in civ 2.
 - If you paradrop a unit into unknown terrain and the terrain contains
   an enemy unit the paradropping unit is lost. If you drop into terrain
   you thought was land, but which has changed to water, the unit is
   also lost.
 - diplomats/spies can't take action from a ship.
 - Refueling air units at turn update will refuel units with only 1 fuel
   first. Secundary criteria is unit cost.
 - Trireme loss percentage depends upon known technologies.
 - Leonardo's workshop will upgrade a random unit each turn, and not
   just the next one.
 - Allied cities count as friendly when determining whether a unit is
   being agressive. (gives unhappyness under some govs.)

   different sizes and styles.
 - Allow specifying unambiguous player name prefix, instead of full 
   player name, for server commands taking a player name argument.
 - Added multi-client configuration support.
 - Added 'read' and 'write' server commands.
 - Added "best nation" column to Demographics report.
 - Changed Fighters and Stealth Fighters to not cause unhappiness (Civ2).

   directly from the CVS <http://www.freeciv.org/contribute.html#SetupCVS>,
   or from a CVS Snapshot <http://www.freeciv.org/latest.html>.)
 - Lots of bug fixes, code cleanups, and help-text improvements.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.8.1:

 - Internationalization added.  Some aspects still need improvement,
   and in particular currently only works well if client and server
   both use the same language.  Initial (partial) translations
   included are: de es fr hu pl pt pt_BR.
 - Improvements to "trident" tileset, and this set is now the default.
 - New ruleset support for NATIONS, and many new nations added --
   there are now 32 nations in the default nations file.  Also allow
   multiple leaders choices for each nation, allow longer player
   names, and allow specifying/choosing sex of leader.
 - New ruleset support for TERRAIN, and changes to allow Civ2 style
   terrain with more specials, multi-terrain rivers, and new farmland
   infrastructure.  Moved some server options into terrain ruleset,
   and added new rule option regarding movement along rivers.
 - New ruleset support for GOVERNMENTS, and more general unit upkeep.
 - The contents and layout of the graphics files is now described in
   user-editable 'spec' files, instead of being hardwired into the
   code; see README.graphics for details.
 - Changes to city graphics: can now see cities grow.  Also, code
   support for different city styles for different nations, and for
   technology dependent styles, but lacking good graphics except for
   the default style.  Cities show a small flag when occupied by one
   or more units.
 - From Civ2, added Paratroopers unit and Airbase infrastructure.
 - Initial window size of Gtk+ client is smaller, to fit better on
   smaller screens, and can now resize detached chat/output window.
 - City report enhancements: New "Change All" dialog to convert all
   production of a given item to some other item (both clients); can
   select multiple cities and issue commands (Gtk+ client only); can
   sort by different columns (Gtk+ client only).  Can also select
   multiple items in the Trade Report (Gtk+ client only).
 - In Civ2 style, can select which infrastructure item to pillage, and
   multiple units can pillage together.  Can now pillage fortresses,
   as well as new farmland and airbase infrastructure items.
 - More fields added to Demographics Report, and now configurable from
   a server option.
 - Added more information to "Active Units Report", and renamed to
   "Military Report".
 - New cursors added for Goto, Nuke and Paradrop modes; <Escape> key
   cancels Go-To/Paradrop/nuke mode; pollution on city squares is now
   always clearly visible; improvements to refresh method for pixmaps
   in Gtk+ client; various other improvements to both clients.
 - Autosettlers no longer convert Plains/Grasslands to Forests, but
   will now Transform terrain.
 - AI can build spaceships, although does not do so very aggressively
   or intelligently yet.
 - Server and client may specify a different metaserver to use.  There
   is now a metaserver running on www.freeciv.org, and that is now the
   default metaserver (http://www.freeciv.org/metaserver).
 - New server option for "turn blocking" mode, in which players will
   never miss a turn even if sometimes disconnected.
 - More flexible rulesets for units and techs (advances) allowing
   variable number of items in each (up to 200) and no longer any
   techs with hardwired effects depending on position in ruleset file.
 - Appropriate helptext now appears in ruleset files, allowing
   modpacks to give modified help to correspond to modified items.
 - Format of ruleset files is changed, no longer compatible with
   those for 1.8.0 and 1.8.1.
 - Removed science bonus of +1 per city per turn.
 - In Civ2 mode, overflight of a hut causes it to disappear, and can't
   build cities next to each other.
 - Rapture_size now 3, to conform to Civ2.
 - Settlers and Engineers now cost shield upkeep as well as food
   upkeep (depending on government type) as in both Civ1 and Civ2.
 - Helicopters do not lose hitpoints when over an airbase.
 - The amount of food required for a city grow is now ((citysize+1) *
   foodbox), instead of (citysize * foodbox); new behavior matches
   both Civ1 and Civ2.
 - Some re-organization of data directory, in adding data/scenario,
   and graphics now in data/trident, data/engels and data/misc.
 - Preliminary support for compiling the server on Mac (but networking
   code not yet ported).
 - Progressively moving code out of client gui-dependent directories.
 - Lots of bug fixes, code cleanups, and help-text improvements.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.8.0:

 - The biggest change is a new client which uses the popular Gtk+
   toolkit.  The old Xaw client is still included as well.
 - A new alternate (30x30) tileset: the "trident" tileset.
   Start the client with "--tiles trident" to try it out.
   (This replaces the "classic/brunus" tileset, which is still
   available separately from the Freeciv ftp site.)
 - In the Gtk+ client, parts of the main window can be detached.
   Detaching them all allows a full-screen map window!
 - The data directory can now be specified as a "path" ($FREECIV_PATH),
   instead of a single directory.  By default, ~/.freeciv is now in
   the path, so if you download new tiles, modpacks, etc, you can now
   simply put them in ~/.freeciv
 - Server console improvements: can abbreviate server command names,
   and server option names.  Better prompt handling - eg, server no
   longer prints an unnecessary prompt each turn.
 - Server commands can now be issued from the client chatline.
   There is a new server command "cmdlevel", to control access to
   this feature on a per-player basis.
 - Some of the "small" graphics have been improved.
 - Added a nice cursor for selecting the destination for "goto".
 - New column "corruption" in the city report.
 - Implemented Marco Polo's Embassy wonder.
 - New command to explode Nuclear units at an empty square.
 - Improved behavior of Caravans and "goto": the Caravan dialog will
   now popup when the Caravan arrives, whether moving by goto or by
   the keyboard.
 - Allow connecting to metaserver (in client) via $http_proxy.
 - Minor "Zone of Control" (ZOC) rules changes to better match Civ2.
 - Improved debug logging.
 - Server will refuse to run as root, as a security measure.
 - As always: lots of bug fixes, code cleanups, and help-text
   improvements.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.7.2:

 - Space race!  Be the first player to build a space ship and colonize
   Alpha Centauri.
 - Civil war!  Capturing the enemy capital may split his empire.  Half
   of his towns will join a new AI leader!
 - Two tile sets in this release! The "big" ones are from Ralph Engels.
   I hope you will enjoy them.  The second set is an enhancement of the
   classic ones.  The server option -tiles allows to choose a subdirectory
   of the data directory to use different tiles.  (The data directory can
   be set with the DATADIR environment variable.)  Also, diagonal roads
   and railroads are now drawn.  Changed some of the national flags
   (especially changed Soviet flag to the Russian flag for Russians).
 - Rulesets can be used to customise units, advances, wonders, and
   improvements without recompiling -- see README.rulesets.
 - Units in a town can be put in auto-attack mode.  In this mode, they
   will attack any enemy units which come nearby.
 - New city options for each city, controlling whether new citizens are
   workers or specialists, whether to allow disbanding a size 1 city by
   building a settler, and options for units on auto-attack mode in the
   city.
 - Mapgen 4 (selected with the server command "set generator 4") is a new
   map generator which generates a map with 2 players on each island.
 - Cities can be a traded in diplomatic treaties.  This effectively
   allows you to exchange, sell or buy cities.
 - The AI now builds diplomats to defend against enemy diplomats.
 - Settlers and engineers can do teamwork.  With enough manpower, all
   terrain improvements can be done fast!
 - With engineers, the terrain type can be changed using the new Transform
   command ('O').  For example, hills can be turned into plains.
 - Units only regenerate hit points if they have not moved at all for a
   full turn.
 - Gamelog option.  The whole history of a game can be stored in the
   gamelog file.
 - One can select a unit with 0 moves left from the main map.
 - City workers can be adjusted from the main map, with shift+button1.
 - Changed the order of libraries to fix problems on IRIX and Cygwin.
 - Changed the client-server protocol to use network byte order.
 - Other bug fixes and code and help text cleanups.

   properly on all systems.
 - Ability to configure to use Xaw3d instead of the normal Xaw.
 - New "easy" AI mode, which is now the default.

   button.
 - Improved multi-column "Unit Select" dialog when there are lots of
   units.
 - In city dialog, middle-click unit icons to "activate and close".
 - New client command "t" to show tiles used by city under mouse.
 - New metaserver dialog to make connecting to metaserver games easier.
 - Ability to save and re-load client settings.
 - Clearer Yes/No toggle buttons in various places in the client.
 - Reduced color usage (but looks almost identical), so the client should
   now work fine on systems with 8 bit color displays.
 - Ability to use "scenarios", that is, pre-designed maps.  Scenarios
   for Earth and Europe games are included in the data directory.
   (Use them with the server command-line option -f, like savegames.)
 - More city names, so you're less likely to see "City 41" etc.
 - Saving large games is now much faster, and the savefile is smaller.
 - Improvements to the documentation and online help system, including
   a new help section on the "Zones of Control" game concept.
 - Detect repeated log messages and print repeat counts.
 - New server options randseed and aqueductloss.
 - Many other enhancements and bug fixes.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.7.0:

 - Removed two C++-style comments, the most reported problem with 1.7.0!
 - Tweaks to the configure script for Solaris, although it's still not
   perfect.
 - Spy and diplomat improvements.
 - Added the "W" command, which Wakes up sentried units.

 - We now recommend you use "configure" instead of Imake.
 - Settlers have a new "e"xplore mode.
 - The makefiles now contain auto-generated dependency information.
 - Units within the radius of the city to which they belong no longer
   cause unhappiness.  This will allow much more realistic defense
   scenarios.
 - The tax/lux/sci rates are now limited by your government type.
   Also, they can modified by clicking on the rate status icons.
 - The behaviour of spies and diplomats has been greatly improved.
 - Freeciv now needs to transmit a lot less data (<25%!) when playing
   over the Internet.  This will greatly speed up games.
 - Preliminary support for compiling Freeciv under Windows and OS/2,
   when used in conjunction with the GNU tools.
 - From now on, it will be possible for different Freeciv versions to
   talk to each other if they're able.
 - Tracy Reed (who provides www.freeciv.org) reports that our site is
   getting over 6,000 hits per month.  He was quoted as saying "Cool!
   Now my computer is doing something!"
 - Lots, and Lots, and Lots of donated patches. Thanks guys, keep 'em
   coming!
