Welcome to Freeciv 1.7!

Thanks again to all our developers, who continue to work so hard.

KNOWN BUGS:

Freeciv 1.7 will be the first stable release since 1.6.3, and will be
considered bug-free enough for everyday use.  But first, we want to release
a series of beta versions.  These will be numbered 1.6.4 and higher.

However if you do find one, please report it (or other problems) to
the freeciv-dev mailing list.  For instructions on how to do this, see:

THINGS TO DO:

 - goto should be looked at, as units with moves left after a goto should
   be active but aren't.

 - There may be some problem with cities being irrigated.
