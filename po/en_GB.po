" 0. Choosing the first city site.\n"
"\n"
"    Start the game by wandering around BRIEFLY to find a good place to build "

"villages yet - they might contain barbarian tribes.  Build the city close to "

"site you find against getting your first city established as early as "
"possible."
msgstr ""

#: data/helpdata.txt:102

" 1. Mapping the countryside.\n"
"\n"
"    After the capital city has been founded, it will start producing a "

"countryside.  Remember, it is risky to leave a city undefended, so perhaps "

"    At this point, defend your cities by always leaving a warrior unit in "

"The Citizen Governor (formerly called the CMA) helps you manage your cities. "
"It deploys the available workers on the free tiles around the city to "
"achieve maximal city output. It also changes workers to scientists, taxmen, "
"or entertainers, if appropriate. And the governor has another ability: "
"whenever possible, it keeps your cities content.\n"
"\n"
"There are various means to tell the governor what kind of output you would "
"like. Open the city window and click on the governor tab. There are two "
"kinds of sliders: On the left, you can set a Minimal Surplus for each kind "
"of production; e.g. Gold = +3 means the city earns 3 gold more than it needs "
"to upkeep its improvements. On the right, the sliders let you define by how "
"much you prefer one kind of production to another; setting science to 3 "
"means you prefer a single bulb to three shields (or gold, trade,...). You "
"can set different factors for each kind of production, according to your "
"needs.\n"
"\n"
"If you set up some Minimal Surpluses which are impossible to fulfill, the "
"governor can't be activated. Whenever the governor can't fulfill its task in "
"the ongoing game, it passes back control to you. So you'd better not define "
"too high a surplus; instead, use factors to achieve your goals.\n"
"\n"
"The Celebrate checkbox lets your city - celebrate. This will work only with "
"a high luxury rate. See help about 'Happiness'.\n"
"\n"
"Clicking on 'Control city' puts the city under control of the governor, "
"'Release city' passes control back to you.\n"
"\n"
"For ease of use, you can save your slider setting as a preset with a name. "
"Click on 'add preset' and enter a name for your setting. You can use this "
"preset in every city by just clicking on its name. Also, you can control "
"your setting from within the city report, in the governor column. And you "
"can change it from there (use 'change' --> 'Citizen Governor'), if you have "
"saved it as a preset.\n"
"\n"
"Use 'Game' --> 'Save Settings' to store your presets permanently.\n"
"\n"
"But beware! If you use the governor for some of your cities, you will "
"encounter some difficulties with managing cities nearby, by hand. It's best "
"to manage all cities on an island either by hand or by governor. Read more "
"hints, some background information, and some preset examples in the file "
"README.cma, included with Freeciv.\n"
