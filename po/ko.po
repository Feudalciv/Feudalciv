"The Citizen Governor (formerly called the CMA) helps you manage your cities. "
"It deploys the available workers on the free tiles around the city to "
"achieve maximal city output. It also changes workers to scientists, taxmen, "
"or entertainers, if appropriate. And the governor has another ability: "
"whenever possible, it keeps your cities content.\n"
"\n"
"There are various means to tell the governor what kind of output you would "
"like. Open the city window and click on the governor tab. There are two "
"kinds of sliders: On the left, you can set a Minimal Surplus for each kind "
"of production; e.g. Gold = +3 means the city earns 3 gold more than it needs "
"to upkeep its improvements. On the right, the sliders let you define by how "
"much you prefer one kind of production to another; setting science to 3 "
"means you prefer a single bulb to three shields (or gold, trade,...). You "
"can set different factors for each kind of production, according to your "
"needs.\n"
"\n"
"If you set up some Minimal Surpluses which are impossible to fulfill, the "
"governor can't be activated. Whenever the governor can't fulfill its task in "
"the ongoing game, it passes back control to you. So you'd better not define "
"too high a surplus; instead, use factors to achieve your goals.\n"
"\n"
"The Celebrate checkbox lets your city - celebrate. This will work only with "
"a high luxury rate. See help about 'Happiness'.\n"
"\n"
"Clicking on 'Control city' puts the city under control of the governor, "
"'Release city' passes control back to you.\n"
"\n"
"For ease of use, you can save your slider setting as a preset with a name. "
"Click on 'add preset' and enter a name for your setting. You can use this "
"preset in every city by just clicking on its name. Also, you can control "
"your setting from within the city report, in the governor column. And you "
"can change it from there (use 'change' --> 'Citizen Governor'), if you have "
"saved it as a preset.\n"
"\n"
"Use 'Game' --> 'Save Settings' to store your presets permanently.\n"
"\n"
"But beware! If you use the governor for some of your cities, you will "
"encounter some difficulties with managing cities nearby, by hand. It's best "
"to manage all cities on an island either by hand or by governor. Read more "
"hints, some background information, and some preset examples in the file "
"README.cma, included with Freeciv.\n"

"A Diplomat is an official that carries your dispatches and is authorized to "
"deal with foreign dignitaries. He may also undertake various covert "
"operations with the intent of harming your opponents; Diplomats in your own "
"cities defend them against such actions.\n"
"\n"
"Many covert actions may be attempted even in peacetime, but the more "
"aggressive actions will be discovered and cause diplomatic incidents, which "
"can allow Republics and Democracies to break treaties.\n"
"\n"
"If a foreign unit is alone on a tile, you may attempt to bribe it with your "
"Diplomat. By paying a sum of gold the unit will immediately become yours; "
"the exact sum depends on the status of the unit and that of the civilization "
"owning it. However, units belonging to Democratic governments cannot be "
"bribed. Bribery when not at war will cause a diplomatic incident.\n"
"\n"
"Diplomats can also perform a number of actions in another player's city, "
"although each Diplomat may attempt only one action. Most of these actions "
"have a chance of failure. Also, any enemy Diplomats or Spies in the city "
"will oppose hostile actions; in this case, either your unit or the defending "
"unit will die. If the defending unit dies, you lose one movement point and "
"may try again.\n"
"\n"
"The actions available to Diplomats in a city are:\n"
"\n"
" - \"Establish Embassy\": This action always succeeds, and gives permanent "
"contact with the city's owner, as well as intelligence on their tax rates "
"and technology.\n"
"\n"
" - \"Investigate City\": Your unit attempts to report detailed information "
"about the city: its status, what buildings and units are within, and what it "
"is currently producing.\n"
"\n"
" - \"Sabotage City\": Your unit attempts either to disrupt all the city's "
"work so far towards its current project, or to destroy an existing building "
"in the city, at random. Once built, Palaces and Wonders cannot be sabotaged, "
"and attempts to sabotage City Walls or any building in a capital each halve "
"the chance of success. Sabotage may only be attempted when openly at war.\n"
"\n"
" - \"Steal Technology\": Your unit attempts to learn the secrets of a random "
"technology known to the city's owner but not to you. Technology may only be "
"stolen once from a given enemy city by Diplomats. This action may be "
"attempted even when not at war, but will cause a diplomatic incident.\n"
"\n"
" - \"Incite a Revolt\": In return for gold a foreign city will change "
"allegiance and join your empire, bringing along all nearby units that call "
"it home, but reducing its size by 1. Units in other cities remain in the "
"enemy's control, but units outside cities are lost to both players. The "
"exact sum depends on the status of the city and that of the civilization "
"that owns it. It is not possible to incite a rebellion in a capital, or in "
"any city governed by a democracy. Incitement may be attempted in peacetime, "
"but will cause a diplomatic incident.\n"
"\n"
"In some game strategies, hordes of Diplomats can be used to wreak havoc on "
