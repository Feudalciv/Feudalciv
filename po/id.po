Rurik established Kievan Rus' in this realm, the first Russian state. By the 11th century, Kievan Rus' had disintegrated into lesser princedoms, which were once again united into one state by Ivan III in the 15th century. After decisive victory over Sweden and large territorial gains, Peter I pronounced the Russian Empire in 1721. The Russian Empire lasted until 1917 when a socialist revolution dethroned the last Russian emperor. After USSR dissolution in 1991 Russia appeared on world map again, now as a federative republic."
msgstr "Menurut legenda, pada tahun 862, suku Novgorod meminta Raja Rurik dari Varangian (Viking) untuk memerintah. Kemudian Raja Rurik mendirikan Kievan Rus', negara Rusia pertama. Pada abad ke-11, Kievan Rus' mengalami perpecahan sampai akhirnya disatukan kembali oleh Ivan III pada abad ke-15. Setelah menang dari Swedia dan menguasai wilayah yang besar, Peter I mendirikan kekaisaran Rusia pada tahun 1721. Kekaisaran ini berakhir pada tahun 1917 setelah revolusi kaum sosialis menggulingkan kaisar terakhirnya. Setelah jatuhnya Uni Soviet pada 1991, Rusia kembali berdiri, tetapi sebagai republik federal."

"- Only land units are restricted by ZOC.\n"
"\n"
"- Non-land units can impose ZOC (that is, count as enemy occupied tiles), but only if they are on a land tile.  So effectively sea units cannot impose ZOC (unless they are in a city), and air units (including helicopters) do not impose ZOC if they are over ocean tiles.\n"

"- ZOC does not restrict unit attacks, only movement.\n"
"\n"
"- An enemy city counts as an enemy occupied tile if there are any units inside the city, but not if the city is empty. (This is the same rule as for any other tile).\n"

Benin united a large area of land west of the Niger river delta, reaching its peak in the 16th century. Eweka I founded the Uzama, or Councilors of State, to aid in the accession of a new Oba, or king. Its fortunes waned as Europeans chose other kingdoms to trade with after Benin's main port silted up. The Kingdom finally ended in 1897 when the British assumed control."

This state united the Kingdom of Poland with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and was founded by the Lithuanian grand duke Jogaila, who was baptized with name Wladyslaw. The presence of the first Polish community in Lithuania dates back to duke Mindaugas of Lithuania. The first Poles came to Lithuania as role of prisoners of war taken during raids on the frontier lands (mainly to Mazovia). After uniting the two countries there was a very strong Polonization of the Lithuanian nobility. The Polish-speaking community in Lithuania survived the collapse and partition of the Polish state, co-existing with Lithuanian-speaking people. In 1920, the rebellious general Zeligowski announced the creation of a Republic of Central Lithuania, which was then incorporated into Poland. After World War II most of the Lithuanian Poles were displaced to Poland's new western territories."

In the early Middle Ages the Frisians controlled a kingdom stretching from the Scheldt to Jutland. Although eventually defeated by the Franks, they kept enjoying the famous Frisian freedom, refusing to recognize the rule of any feudal lord. In the 15th and 16th centuries Frisian territory was eventually carved up, the core becoming a province of the United Netherlands. In 1782 the Estates of Friesland was the first foreign government to recognize the independence of the United States of America."

The Axumite kingdom from Ethiopia ruled Sabaea from 340 to 378 AD, but the area was reconquered by Himyar forces in 525. The fall of the nation was a slow process involving the Christian states of Axum and the Byzantine Empire on one side, the Mandean Sassanid Empire of Persia on the other, and various South Arabian factions split between. The country switched from Axumite rule to Sassanid in 575 and in 628, the fifth Sassanid satrap of \"al-Yaman\" converted to Islam and Southern Arabia was incorporated into the new, expanding Muslim empire."
