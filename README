                           Freeciv 1.8 documentation
                           =========================

Welcome to Freeciv!
 
This archive contains Freeciv version 1.8, a free Civilization clone
for X, primarily under Unix.  It has support for multiplayer games
locally or over a network, and an AI which gives most people a run for
their money.

Freeciv aims to be mostly rule-compatible with Civilization II[tm],
published by Sid Meier and Microprose[tm].  A few rules are different
where we think it makes more sense, and we have lots and lots of
adjustable parameters to make customizing games possible.

Freeciv has been implemented completely independently of Civilization;
you do not need to own Civilization to play Freeciv.

Although the graphics are not as polished as those in Civilisation II,
the rules are very complete, and our multiplayer and networking code is
excellent.  At the moment however, we're lacking alliances
A patch is ready but not yet tested.

Compiling and installing:
=========================

Please read the INSTALL file carefully for instructions on how to get
Freeciv compiled and installed on your machine.


Starting a new game:
===================

Freeciv is actually two programs, a server and a client.  When a game
is in progress, there will be one server program running, and as many
client programs as there are human players.  The server does not need
X, but the clients do.

    NOTE:

    The following examples assume that Freeciv has been installed on
    your system, and that the directory containing the "civclient" and
    "civserver" programs is in your PATH.  If Freeciv is not
    installed, then you may want to use the "civ" and "ser" programs,
    which can be found in the top Freeciv directory.  They are used
    in exactly the same fashion as "civclient" and "civserver".

Running Freeciv involves starting the server, then the client(s)
and AI(s), then telling the server to start the game.  Here are the
steps:

Server:

  To start the server:

  % civserver

  Or for a list of command-line options:

  % civserver --help

  Once the server is started, a prompt will appear:

  Get a list of the available commands with 'h'.
  > h

  Available commands: (P=player, M=message, F=file, T=topic)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  h         - this help
  explain   - help on server options
  explain T - help on a particular server option
  l         - list players
  q         - quit game and shutdown server
  c P       - cut connection to player
  remove P  - fully remove player from game
  score     - show current score
  save F    - save game as file F
  show      - list server options
  meta M    - Set meta-server infoline to M
  ai P      - toggles AI on player
  create P  - creates an AI player
  easy P    - AI player will be easy
  easy      - All AI players will be easy
  normal P  - AI player will be normal
  normal    - All AI players will be normal
  hard P    - AI player will be hard
  hard      - All AI players will be hard
  set       - set options
  s         - start game
  > 

  If you like, you can use the 'set' command to set any of the various
  server options for the game.  You can get a list of the options
  with the 'show' command, and explanations with the 'explain' command.

  For example:

  > explain xsize
  Option: xsize
  Description: Map width in squares.
  Status: changeable
  Value: 80, Minimum: 40, Default: 80, Maximum: 200

  > set xsize 100
  > set ysize 80

  This will make the map twice as large as the default of 80x50.

Client:

  Now all the human players should join, by running the Freeciv
  client:

  % civclient

  This assumes the server is running on the same machine.  If not, you
  can either specify it on the command use with the '-server' option,
  or enter it into the first dialog box once the client starts.

  For example, suppose the server is running on a different machine
  called 'neptune'.  Then players would join with a command like:

  % civclient -server neptune

  If you're the only human player, then only one client needs to be
  started.  In standard Unix fashion you can start the client
  "in the background" by appending an ampersand:

  % civclient &

  Another option for the client you may like to try is the '-tiles'
  option, which can be used to select different "tilesets" (that is,
  different graphics for the map terrain, units, and so on).  The
  distribution comes with two tilesets: the default set, and an
  enhanced version of the original tiles, which may be specified 
  by starting the client with:

  % civclient -tiles classic

Computer Players:

  There are two ways to create AI players.  The first is to set 
  the number of players (human and AI) by setting the 'aifill'
  server option.  For example:

  > set aifill 7

  After using the "s" server command to start the game, any players
  which aren't controlled by humans will be AI players.  For the
  above, if two human players had joined, 5 AI players would be
  created.

  The second way is to explicitly create an AI with the 'create'
  server command.  For example:

  > create HumanKiller

  This will create an AI-controlled player called HumanKiller.

  AI players are assigned to tribes after all human players have
  chosen their tribes, but you can choose a particular tribe for an AI
  player by using the normal name for that nation's leader.  For
  example, to play against AI-controlled Romans, use this server
  command:

  > create Caesar

  Note, this is just a preference:  If no other human player chooses
  to play the Romans, then this AI will.

Server:

  When everybody has joined (use the (l)ist command to see who's in), 
  start the game with the (s)start command:

  > s


And the game is on!


Announcing the game:
====================

If you do not want to limit your opponents to local friends or AI players,
visit the Freeciv metaserver:

  http://www.daimi.aau.dk/~lancelot/freeciv.html

It is a list of Freeciv servers.  To make your own server announce itself
there, start civserver with the '--meta' option, or just '-m' for short.

Caveats:

 1) Due to the inclusion of new features, different client and server
    versions are often incompatible.  Not all incompatibilities
    can be caught and reported properly.  One example is a 1.8.0
    client connecting to a 1.7.2 server: the client appears
    to connect, but it never gets any messages from the server.

 2) If the Metaserver button in the connection dialog doesn't work,
    check if your ISP uses a mandatory WWW proxy and make civclient
    use it through the $http_proxy environment variable.  For instance,
    if the proxy is proxy.myisp.com port 8888, set $http_proxy
    to http://proxy.myisp.com:8888/ before starting the client.

 3) The metaserver usually lists several servers (5-10 on average),
    but only a few of them are 1.8.0.  This is due to noise elimination:
    up to 1.7.2, civserver connected to the metaserver by default, and
    as a consequence, most of the pre-1.8.0 servers appearing on the
    metaserver are run by first-time users who haven't even read this
    README file.


Playing the game:
=================

The game may be saved the game at any time using the 'save' server command,
like so:

> save mygame

The Freeciv client works pretty much as you would expect from a
multiplayer civilization game. That is, the players move at the same
time.  There's a turn timeout value, which is by default set to 0
seconds (no timeout).  The server-op can alter this value at any time
with the 'set' command.

Have a look at the online help system. All three mouse-buttons are
used, and documented in the help.

Players can push the 'Return' key to announce the end of their turn,
or just push the 'Turn done' button.

Use the 'Players' dialog to see who has announced their end of turn,
and who you're waiting for.  (Hey feller, are you asleep or what?? ;).

Use the input line at the bottom of the window for broadcasting
messages to other players.

You can send a message to an individual player (say, 'peter') like so:

  peter: move that armor away *NOW*!

The server is smart enough to perform "name completion", so if you had
typed "pet:", it will pick find a player name that matches the part of
the name you typed.

If you're just starting, and would like to get an idea of a strategy,
have a look in the Freeciv playing HOWTO, contained in the HOWTOPLAY
file.

For lots more information about the client, the server, and the
concepts and rules of the game, see the Freeciv manual, available
at the web pages at:

   http://www.freeciv.org/manual/main.html


Ending the game:
================

There are three ways in which a game can end:

1) Only one race is left.
2) The final year is reached.
3) A player builds and launches a spaceship, which reaches Alpha
   Centauri first.

A score-table will be shown in all cases.  Hint: The server-op can set
the final year while the game is still going by changing the
'end-year' option.  This is nice when the winner is obvious, but you
don't want to play through the boring 'cleanup phase'.

Restoring games:
================

You can restore a saved game by using the '-f' server option, eg:

  % civserver -f oursave2001.sav

Now the players can rejoin the game:

  % civclient -n Alexander
  
Notice how the player-name is specified with the -n option. It's vital
that the player uses the same name as they had when the game started,
if they're to be allowed in.

The game may then be restarted with 's' as usual.


Server autostart:
=================

When the maximum number of players have connected, the server auto-starts.
The maximum number of players can be set with the 'maxplayers' option.


Log messages:
=============

Both the client and server print messages known as "log messages".
There are three categories of log messages: "fatal", "normal", and 
"debug".  

By default, fatal and normal messages are printed to standard output
where the client or server was started.  You can direct log messages
to a file instead of the screen with the "--log filename", or "-l
filename" command line options.

You can change the level of log messages displayed with "--debug
level" or "-d level" (for the server) or "-de level" (for the client),
where "level" is 0, 1, or 2.  0 means show fatal messages only, 1
means show fatal and normal messages (the default), and 2 means show
all fatal, normal, and debug messages.

Example: 
	 % civserver -l my.log -d 2

This sends all server log messages to file "my.log", including debug
messages.

Example: 
	 % civclient --debug 0

This suppresses all non-fatal client log messages.

Bugs:
=====

Found a bug?  We really want to hear from you so we can fix it.
Here's what to do:

 - Check the Freeciv website, to ensure you're playing the latest
   version.  (We may have already fixed the problem).

   In particular, you might like to try a development snapshot,
   from our CVS repository.  You can FTP them from:

     http://www.freeciv.org/latest.html

 - Check the Freeciv FAQ on the Freeciv website to see if we've
   published a way to work around your bug.

 - Send us an email!

   - Address the email to "freeciv-dev", the Freeciv developer's
   mailing list, as described below.

   - Describe the problem, including any messages that were displayed.

   - Tell us the name and version of:

       - The Operating System you're using.  You may find the
         "uname -a" command useful.

       - The version number of Freeciv.

       - If you know them, the version numbers of the X libraries, and
         the Xpm library, and the Xaw library (and particularly 
         whether it is standard Xaw, or a variant such as Xaw3d,
         Xaw95, or Nextaw).

       - If you're compiling from source code, the name
         and version number of the compiler.

       - If you're installing from a binary package, the name of
         the package, the distribution it's for, and where you
         got it from.

   - If Freeciv "dumps core", then we may ask you to use a debugger to
   give us a "stack trace".  You'll need the "core" file for this, so
   please hold onto it for a while.
