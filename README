                           =========================
                           Freeciv 1.7 documentation
                           =========================
		       
This archive contains Freeciv version 1.7, a free Civilization clone for X,
primarily under Unix.  It has support for many players over a network, and the
AI is getting harder to beat every release.


Compiling and installing:
=========================
Please read the file INSTALL for instructions on how to get Freeciv compiled 
on your machine.  It's really not very hard.

Please note: 

Freeciv *must* be linked with the _real_ Athena widget library
(libXaw), and not one of the substitutions such as libXaw3d or Nextaw.
If Freeciv is linked with a substitute, the client will crash.

This is important because Freeciv currently relies on an Xaw call that
is not present in the (nicer looking) replacement widget sets. If you
wish to use Xaw3d or Nextaw while still being able to play Freeciv, it
is suggested that you use the Xaw-wrappers program.


Starting a new game:
===================
Server:

  start the server:
  % civserver

  Help on command-line options can be obtained with the --help option.

  get a list of the available commands with 'h':
  >h
  Available commands: (P=player, M=message, F=file)
  -------------------------------------
  c P      - cut connection to player
  h        - this help
  l        - list players
  q        - quit game and shutdown server
  remove P - fully remove player from game
  score    - show current score
  save F   - save game as file F
  show     - list server options
  help     - help on server options
  meta T   - Set meta-server infoline to T
  ai P     - toggles AI on player
  create P - creates an AI player
  set      - set options
  s        - start game

  Now use the 'set' command to set the various variables for the game. 
  You can get a list of the variables with the 'show' command.
  
  You can get option-specific help with: help <option>

  For example:

  > help xsize
  Affects: Width of map in squares
  Minimum 40, Maximum 100, Default 80

  > set xsize 100
  > set ysize 80

  This will make the map slightly bigger than the default (80x50).

Client:
  Now all the players that want to participate in the game should join. 
  Suppose the server is running on the machine 'io'. Then players would 
  join with a command like:

  % civclient -server io

  If the Freeciv server is running on the same machine as the Freeciv
  client, then there's no need to specify the server, as the default in
  the dialog box when the client starts will be "localhost", which means
  your computer.

Computer Player:
  To start an ai player, you must use the <create> command from the server.  
  For example
  > create HumanKiller
  This will start up an ai player called HumanKiller.  Once the game starts and
  all of the human players have chosen their tribes, the ai players will be
  assigned to tribes.  You can force the ai to play a specific tribe by giving
  it the normal name for that nation's leader.  For example
  > create Ceasar
  Will start an ai player as the Romans.  Unless you take precautions, this
  player can be usurped.

Server:
  When everybody has joined (use the (l)ist command to see who's in), the
  server-op starts the game with the (s)start command:
  > s
  starting game.

And the game is on!

Note:  If you don't want to send information to the metaserver when you start
the game you can give the server the --nometa flag, or just -n for short.
Also, for those people who have used older versions which had ai (eg, 1.5.4),
you no longer have to open a client to get ai to work.


Playing the game:
=================
The server-op can save the game at any time using the 'save' command,
like so:

> save mygame

As for the the clients, everything is pretty much as you would expect from
a multiplayer civilization game. That is, the players move at the same time.
There's a turn timeout value, which is by default set to 0 seconds (no
timeout). The server-op can alter this value at any time with the 'set'
command.

Have a look at the online help system. All three mouse-buttons are used,
and documented in the help.

Players can push the 'Return' key to announce the end of their turn, or just
push the 'Turn done' button.

Use the 'Players' dialog to see who has announced their end of turn, and who
you're waiting for.  (Hey feller, are you asleep or what?? ;).

Use the input line at the bottom of the window for broadcasting messages to
other players. The server is smart enough to perform "name completion", so
if  you type "pet:", it will pick find a player name that matches the part
of the name you typed.

You can send a message to an individual player (say, 'peter') like so:

  peter: move that armor away *NOW*!


Ending the game:
================
There are two ways in which a game can end:

1) Only one race is left.
2) The final year is reached.

A score-table will be shown in both cases. 
Hint: The server-op can set the final year at run-time by changing the 
end-year variable. This is nice when the winner is obvious, but you don't
want to play through the boring 'cleanup phase'.


Restoring games:
================

You can restore a saved game by using the '-f' server option, eg:

  % civserver -f oursave2001.sav

Now the players can join the game:

  % civclient -n Alexander -s io
  
Notice how the player-name is specified with the -n option. It's vital
that the player uses the same name if they're to be allowed in.

The server-op can now start the game with 's' as usual. Notice that
additional players can join the game even if it has been started.


Server autostart:
=================
When the maximum number of players have connected, the server auto-starts.
The maximum number of players can be set with the 'maxplayers' variable.


Bugs:
=====
Should you find any bugs then please send us an email specifying what's
wrong. It might be helpful for us if you specify which OS/version/compiler
you're using.  (Try typing 'uname -a').

Bugs should be sent to the freeciv-dev mailing list.  The instructions for
doing this can be found at the page below.

Homepage:
=========
We maintain a homepage for the game at:

  http://www.freeciv.org

You should check out the page, as it contains much more information than
this file and the online help. This is also where we'll inform people about 
new releases/bugs/fixes/competitions, etc.


New Releases:
=============
New releases will first be made available at:
  ftp://www.freeciv.org/pub/freeciv

Have fun and now go give 'em hell!
