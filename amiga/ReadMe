Short:     Amiga Version 1.5 => Freeciv 1.9.0
Uploader:  sebauer@t-online.de (Sebastian Bauer)
Author:    sebauer@t-online.de (Sebastian Bauer), Freeciv Development Team
Type:      game/2play
Kurz:      Amiga Version 1.5 => Freeciv 1.9.0
Requires:  OS 3.0, guigfx.library, MUI 3.8, NList, TCP/IP Stack
Version:   1.5

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a native compile of Freeciv. It also has an own client which is
using MUI. That means you don't need to have ixemul.library or a XServer.
Actually the client is not completly ready yet, but most things should
work.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - 68020 processor
 - OS 3.0
 - MUI 3.8
 - NList 0.89
 - TCP/IP Stack
 - guigfx.library (needs render.library version 30 itself)

Note, some that some combinations of the picture.datatype and ilbm.datatype
doesn't work correctly.
Following combinations seem to work:
  picture.datatype 43.764 (CGFX) and ilbm.datatype 44.19 (by Stephan Rupprecht)
  picture.datatype 43.33 (P96; also works on AGA) and ilbm.datatype 44.19
  picture.datatype 44.19 and ilbm.datatype 44.8 (both are in OS3.5)
  picture.datatype 43.41 (P96 V1.43a) and ilbm.datatype 40.3 (orginal OS 3.1)
Please contact me if you use other datatypes and Freeciv works correctly
with them.

Also always use the latest guigfx.library. The current version is 16.2
and this can be found at:
 http://209.201.55.167/binarydistillery/guigfx/guigfxlib.lha.
or Aminet

Render.library can be found at
 http://209.201.55.167/binarydistillery/renderlib/renderlib.lha
Again. guigfx.library version 16.2 needs at least render.library
version 30. Other (newer) guigfx libraries may require later versions.

Please also let Freeciv open on a big enough screen. A screen with the
size of 640x256 is not enough (at least at the moment)

Usage
~~~~~
Freeciv is a multiplayer game and divided into sever and client. But
of course it's also possible to play freeciv on a single machine.

The first step is to start your TCP/IP stack (e.g. Miami). You don't
need to go online if you only want to play Freeciv on a single machine.
The next step is starting the server and then the client. You can do
this eighter with help of the Workbench or from the Shell (Freeciv
allocates hopefully enough stack itself so you needn't set a high
stack value). After the client has been loaded you can connect to the
server.
Alternativly you can start the server and the client with the provided
Freeciv.start shell scripts. Before it loads the server and client it
opens a filerequester where you can choose whether to load an old game
or start a new game.

For more details on usage view the README.org and HOWTOPLAY files, which are
also included in this package.

Authors
~~~~~~~
The authors who are participated in the Freeciv project are listed in the
AUTHORS and PEOPLE files.

The Amiga Version of the client was created, as well as the server was
compiled, by Sebastian Bauer. If you have question or problems with this
version, feel free to ask me.

Future
~~~~~~
 - still some few things which are missing

Notes
~~~~~
This version is incompatible with the previous version 1.3. That means
with the included client you cannot connect to a old server. Also old
clients cannot connect to the included server.

History
~~~~~~~
Version 1.5 (07.11.99)
 - corresponds to Freeciv 1.9.0

Version 1.4 (20.10.99)
 - corresponds to Freeciv 1.9.0
 - workaround for the unit blink problem
